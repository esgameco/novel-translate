        <h1>Chapter 849</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Why did this 'good friend' ability fail when the other source abilities are still working fine?"</p><p></p><p>He pondered, then teleported to the small world where the humans were imprisoned, and began to use the 'good friend' ability, trying to see if these humans could become his friends.</p><p></p><p>Soon he discovered that this ability had indeed failed.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the second-level world and found Su Hao, asking: "Grand Master Wei, I've found that the 'good friend' source ability has lost its effect on the dragons and humans of this world. Do you know what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "I've researched this before, it's related to the soul power of this world. I've done special tests - not only has the 'good friend' ability lost its effect, almost all 'spells' that modify consciousness have also lost their effects."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng couldn't help frowning. In his understanding, source abilities that modify consciousness were among the most bizarre and unresolvable abilities. As long as the triggering conditions were met, almost no one could resist the erosion of such source abilities - they could be considered rule-level abilities.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't expect that such a rule-level ability would lose its effect on the humans of this world.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help asking, "How is this possible? Could it be that soul power can resist source abilities?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head: "No, it's not that. When you cast source abilities, they do take effect. But the soul cultivators of this world are special - their consciousness essentially no longer exists in their brain matter, but rather exists within their soul power. Simply put, their consciousness exists within soul power, and soul power carries the consciousness, attaching to the brain.</p><p></p><p>It looks about the same, but the order is different, which directly causes our consciousness-modifying source abilities to lose effect.</p><p></p><p>Because the source abilities we currently grasp essentially modify the brain, but the main consciousness of these soul cultivators no longer exists in the brain, modifying the brain won't have any effect on them.</p><p></p><p>To make our consciousness-based source abilities work on these soul cultivators, we need to thoroughly analyze the principle of how soul power carries consciousness, and then modify our source abilities accordingly. But that can't be done right away."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng's face wrinkled up: "So that's why those dragons and humans all looked at me like I was an idiot, how vexing!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed: "You should be happy that you've made a new discovery. Even if everyone treats me like an idiot, I'd be happy as long as more forces like soul power are available for me to study.</p><p></p><p>If we can successfully analyze the characteristics of soul power, perhaps our 'journey of death' will end. In the future, we'll only grow stronger and stronger, without dying and having to start over again."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng exclaimed in surprise: "Grand Master Wei, are you saying this soul power could make us immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head: "Based on my research on these White Galars so far, it doesn't seem certain. From my study of these White Galars over this period of time, those White Galars appear eternal, but they actually have an extreme lifespan limit. The White Galars are collapsing at an extremely slow rate, but this rate is so slow that it's imperceptible under normal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>The reason these deities believe themselves to be eternal life is simply because they haven't reached the White Galars' lifespan limit yet.</p><p></p><p>As long as there is a limit, no matter how long that limit is, the moment of termination will eventually arrive on the scale of the universe.</p><p></p><p>However, after thoroughly studying the White Galars, we may be able to find another path to gain eternity in a different way."</p><p></p><p>As for whether they could gain eternity, Wind Cheng had full confidence in Su Hao. The "perhaps" that Su Hao mentioned sounded like "definitely" to his ears.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly a question popped into his mind: "Eternity...with so much time, what will I do in the future?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while without figuring it out, he shook his head and thought: "Why worry about that? Wherever Grand Master Wei goes, I'll go. Whatever he asks me to do, I'll do it. He'll help me figure out what I should do."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng curiously asked: "Grand Master Wei, what exactly is this soul power?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head: "I'm not sure yet, but through my research over this period, I've made some discoveries. Perhaps soul power is an amalgamation of 'energy', 'information', and 'motion' combined into one. And these unique White Galar lifeforms are perhaps just faint consciousnesses that formed by chance over a long period of time from these amalgamations, with only simple instincts like 'division' and 'renewal'. Exactly how, I still need to find an opportunity to release the White Galars from within the deities' bodies and converse with them to find out."</p><p></p><p>After listening to Su Hao, Wind Cheng developed a strong curiosity about these White Galar creatures: "Why don't we just use the 'Galactic Network' to find the White Galars' homeland directly?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "If I could find it quickly, I would have acted already. The key is we don't know what kind of planets the White Galars live on - on the surface or in the core. We have no way to know, so the search process requires carefully examining each planet one by one. We can't just glance through like in our previous life. To thoroughly search a galaxy would take no less than a couple hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how many good things we missed with our previous casual galaxy search method? Now that I think about it, not all life has to be in flesh form. Crystal form, gaseous form, liquid form, information form... they're all possible! And often these forms of life can bring us a wealth of unexpected knowledge...</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng, once we acquire enough knowledge, the brilliant universe will open its embrace to us completely, allowing us to roam freely. Just imagine what it will be like when we can use our own power to wander through the vast nebulae in the future!"</p><p></p><p>The more Su Hao spoke, the more excited he became, his spirit of exploration once again reaching new heights.</p><p></p><p>When he was weak, he could only tour the limited areas on a single planet;</p><p></p><p>As he grew stronger, he could fly into the sky and freely roam among the clouds;</p><p></p><p>Later on, instead of just guessing at the appearance of a bright star in the night sky, he could approach it and observe it;</p><p></p><p>At that time, he could proudly point to a nebula and tell the universe: "This is the domain of me, Su Hao."</p><p></p><p>The splendor and mystery of the universe surpasses the imagination of the human mind.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng murmured excitedly: "Nebulae..."</p><p></p><p>Carried away by Su Hao's raving, Wind Cheng's mind wavered uncontrollably, his divine clone's face flushing red rarely, his body twisting left and right uncontrollably, his mind filled with visions of himself standing with hands on hips, floating before an infinitely vast nebula, laughing uproariously.</p><p></p><p>Just imagining it made it seem breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, he finally regained his senses. When he went to find Grand Master Wei again, he discovered that Wei had already started working.</p><p></p><p>He marveled: "As expected of Grand Master Wei, able to recover so quickly from an excited state and focus his energy on the task at hand. Such perseverance and concentration is rare! Or perhaps I've never seen anyone so focused and hardworking - Grand Master Wei's immense strength is well-grounded."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng secretly resolved: "Focus, focus, only by focusing can one do things well. No matter how grand the goal, one must take solid steps forward bit by bit. Yes, I should go deal with those dragons and humans first, that is the task before me now."</p><p></p><p>As for how to befriend the dragons and those soul cultivators, he had a new idea: since the 'good friend' source ability didn't work, then he would use the simplest, most brutal method - kill anyone unwilling to be his friend, and those left would be friends.</p><p></p><p>This was a method Elder Ah Shan often taught him, and it should work well when applied to making friends too.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng returned to the small world imprisoning the dragons. Looking down at the mass of black dragons, he couldn't help revealing a cruel smile.</p><p></p><p>The dragons also noticed Wind Cheng's sudden appearance and immediately became agitated, spreading their wings to fly towards him, mouths slightly open and breaths brimming.</p><p></p><p>They all believed that the reason they were imprisoned here was because of the person above, so the dragons had already discussed that as soon as that person appeared, they would seize the opportunity to kill him while caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>Surely by killing this person, they could find the exit from this prison.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the group of dragons flying over, Wind Cheng swept out his Wish-Fulfilling Staff, knocking all the dragons to the ground. He then used spatial structures to restrain their bodies so they couldn't move, leaving only their heads free.</p><p></p><p>Then he slowly approached the dragons and declared loudly: "I'll state it one last time - your only way out is to become my friend, otherwise it's death. Choose!"</p><p></p><p>He came up to the most ferocious black lightning dragon and asked: "Dear dragon sir, would you be willing to be my friend?"</p><p></p><p>That black lightning dragon cursed loudly: "Foolish human, I would rather..."</p><p></p><p>"Poosh!"</p><p></p><p>A massive black dragon head went flying, with a torrent of black blood gushing out like a high-pressure soy sauce hose from the severed neck.</p><p></p><p>The other dragons fell silent for a moment, then became even more frenzied.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng approached the second black lightning dragon and asked: "Dear dragon sir, would you be willing to be my friend?"</p><p></p><p>That dragon's eyes were bloodred as it looked at Wind Cheng like an enemy: "Foolish human, you had better..."</p><p></p><p>"Poosh!"</p><p></p><p>The second head rolled away.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng then went to the third dragon and loudly asked the same question.</p><p></p><p>After many of the most ferocious, aggressive dragons had their heads taken off, Wind Cheng came to Mu Zhi Saku and asked: "Dear dragon sir, would you be willing to be my friend?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Zhi Saku, looking at the river of blood, roared in terror: "I'm willing! From today, Sir Wind Cheng, you are my, Mu Zhi Saku's, very best friend, second to none."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng finally couldn't help but laugh out loud, patting Mu Zhi Saku's head: "Good, you Mu Zhi Saku are my first dragon friend. Now, I appoint you as the Dragon Governor to work for me."</p><p></p><p>Mu Zhi Saku shed tears of gratitude: "Thank you for Sir Wind Cheng's generosity."</p><p></p><p>It was unclear if he was excited or just terrified.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the other dragons also became Wind Cheng's friends one after another.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng sent Ah Shan a message, praising: "Elder Ah Shan, I used the method you taught me and successfully made many dragon friends, hahaha, it really works."</p><p></p><p>Ah Shan: "What method???"</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng: "The downward compatible effective communication method."</p><p></p><p>With confidence, Wind Cheng went to the small world imprisoning the humans next...</p><p></p><p>To Wind Cheng, if these humans and dragons could not help explore the starry cosmos, then their lives held little meaning.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 603</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Five days later, Hefahshi was sent back to New Era City by Yashan.</p><p></p><p>After returning to New Era City, the feeling of freely controlling source power returned to him.</p><p></p><p>With just a thought, the entire New Era City fell within his perception.</p><p></p><p>If he wished, he could pull everyone in New Era City into an illusory dream at any time!</p><p></p><p>Even Lada's "Lockfist" was powerless against Hefahshi, because as long as it was perceived and known, it was all an illusion created by Hefahshi. They would never know his true location.</p><p></p><p>The recovery of his power did not bring Hefahshi any joy, because he knew that if Jiawei wished, the "suppressor" within a 200 kilometer range could deprive him of everything he had.</p><p></p><p>"Is the power I wield true power? To have it stripped from me so easily...perhaps I have never known what the 'source' truly is."</p><p></p><p>He silently withdrew his power. None of the people in New Era City noticed that for that brief moment, they had all lived in the dream constructed by Hefahshi, seamlessly entering and exiting reality.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his palm, slowly clenching his fist: "Perhaps, cooperating with Jiawei is a good choice."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Hefahshi locked onto a person leading a search team in New Era City with his perception, directly transmitting his voice: "Qishou, come see me at the Hebu meeting hall."</p><p></p><p>The man named Qishou was a handsome middle-aged man in armor. Upon hearing the voice, he had an ecstatic expression and immediately waved, "Regroup!"</p><p></p><p>He then ran towards Hebu.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the base small world.</p><p></p><p>Lada bellowed, "Hefahshi! That old man - where did he go?"</p><p></p><p>Dumeng guessed, "Could he have really returned to New Era City?"</p><p></p><p>But Lada didn't believe it, "You actually believed his nonsense? Who would come to this place for negotiations? Moreover, that Hefahshi guy isn't one to take such risks easily. He's very cunning. He must have been captured."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Feixiao and others came over and said, "Godfather, it seems Hefahshi really did return."</p><p></p><p>Lada's eyes widened, "What? How do you know?"</p><p></p><p>Feixiao said, "Today when cooperating with the experiment, I casually asked Jiawei, and he said he sent Hefahshi back yesterday."</p><p></p><p>Lada cursed, "That damn old man! He only cared about himself and ran away, leaving us behind? If I get out, I'll knock out that old man's two front teeth!"</p><p></p><p>The bespectacled woman curiously asked, "Feixiao, did you ask about the result of their negotiations?"</p><p></p><p>Feixiao nodded, "I did!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared at Feixiao.</p><p></p><p>Feixiao spread his hands, "Jiawei said, 'The result depends on Hefahshi's decision.'"</p><p></p><p>"What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>Feixiao explained, "It's quite obvious. Jiawei probably made some suggestions to Hefahshi and gave him time to consider. If the Association compromises, then we'll be fine. If not, then the two sides will clash, and Jiawei will fight to the end. That's my guess!"</p><p></p><p>Lada asked, "Then guess whether Hefahshi will compromise or not!"</p><p></p><p>Feixiao said, "How would I know? I'm not a psychic!"</p><p></p><p>Lada ruffled Feixiao's curly hair, loudly saying, "I asked you to guess, it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong."</p><p></p><p>Feixiao pulled his head back, "Based on Jiawei's confident demeanor of having everything under control, I guess it doesn't make much difference whether Hefahshi compromises or not!"</p><p></p><p>Lada: "What? He's lost before even fighting? Impossible! That damn old man! If he took me out, I could help him smash through the Glorious Church!"</p><p></p><p>No one paid him any attention.</p><p></p><p>It seemed their Lada Chief had yet to gain a clear understanding of his own strength after being captured.</p><p></p><p>Feixiao suggested, "Godfather, perhaps you could communicate with Mr. Jiawei about how you could be released. Maybe he'll tell you."</p><p></p><p>Lada blurted out, "Fart! Why would I beg him?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>At dusk, Lada sneakily came to the outside of Suhao's lab and knocked on the large door, which soon opened automatically.</p><p></p><p>Suhao wondered, "Lada Chief, what brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>Lada smiled and greeted Suhao, then laughed, "Well, we've been kept here for so long. I wanted to ask when you plan to let us out? Or rather, what do we need to do to be released?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Ah, so that's what this is about! You don't need to be in such a hurry. There will be many occasions where we need you all. Besides, it's still quite chaotic out there, so we can't let you all go out and cause trouble. Wait until the situation stabilizes, then we'll see! Maybe a year or two.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and your knowledge is too lacking. You wouldn't be of much use out there. There are many books in the base. Why don't you all take this opportunity to read and improve yourselves? That little Feixiao isn't bad, always in the library reading books. He's a talent."</p><p></p><p>Lada: "Still...a year?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao corrected, "One to two years, depending on the situation. Anything else?"</p><p></p><p>Lada shook his head, "No."</p><p></p><p>As Lada was about to leave, Suhao called out, "Wait, since you're here, do an experiment with me before you go!"</p><p></p><p>Lada: "......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A few days later, after the records of the sixteen emperors' testimonies were completed, Suhao did find some who had been dishonest when cross-checking with the decoded consciousness information. They had only provided a tiny portion of the royal family's information while mixing in a large number of families close to the royals, intending to use those close families as scapegoats to protect the royal families.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't say much about this.</p><p></p><p>He gathered the sixteen emperors together and casually exploded the heads of the two who had been most deceitful, calmly saying, "These two provided far too little information about the royal families, directly regarded as refusing to cooperate. As they wished, a painless departure."</p><p></p><p>He then gave the remaining fourteen emperors five more days, "If you still take this dismissive attitude with me, then we're done talking."</p><p></p><p>The remaining fourteen emperors turned deathly pale. Without needing the full five days, in just two days, they had laid bare everything about their royal families!</p><p></p><p>As emperors, they were very clear about the composition of their families, saving Suhao a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>The information on the royal families from various regions was soon handed over to Zhipeng by Yashan to begin planning the royal family extermination.</p><p></p><p>According to Yashan's estimate, at least half a year of preparation would be needed to do it properly. One issue was manpower, another was locking down the targets, and another was setting up the transition spheres.</p><p></p><p>Resolving all of this would require a great deal of time.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that after selling out their own families, the fourteen emperors were released by Yashan and allowed to move freely within a designated area of the base. The next day, they ran into Lada and the others.</p><p></p><p>There was no sense of comradery from being in the same predicament. The two sides found each other unsavory, and then Lada's iron fists proved invincible as he gave each of the fourteen emperors a black eye.</p><p></p><p>That's right, even the highly attractive empress wasn't spared.</p><p></p><p>When Lada had source power, his fists were nearly invincible. Even without abilities, ordinary people were no match for him.</p><p></p><p>So in the base's small world, Lada's group and the emperors would frequently clash in brawls, refusing to back down.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's "martial arts" greatly improved!</p><p></p><p>The missing seventeen emperors were presumed dead, and the first heirs of the various regions soon held coronation ceremonies to become the new emperors of the world.</p><p></p><p>Everything proceeded as usual, with the massive imperial machine rolling on. Losing an emperor or two was inconsequential to the bigger picture. When an emperor died, there were thousands upon thousands of others. In theory, as long as one had royal bloodline, there was a chance to ascend to the throne as a new emperor once all other royals perished.</p><p></p><p>The massive interest groups would not allow the royal families to go extinct, nor permit the vast system of vested interests built over many years to collapse.</p><p></p><p>If the royal families fell, then the wealth of those people would shrink considerably in an intangible way.</p><p></p><p>To them, no matter how vast their current wealth, its very nature dictated that it could only grow, not diminish!</p>

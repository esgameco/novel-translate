        <h1>Chapter 846</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Order God - Red Light said impatiently, "My lords, what is the meaning of this? Are we going or not? If not, then disperse. Why bother making a fuss? Don't come to me again if there's anything else. You all can play by yourselves."</p><p></p><p>"What is Lord Red Light saying? Isn't it better to be cautious when the situation is unclear?"</p><p></p><p>Red Light's temper immediately flared up. It was rare to find an opportunity for a good fight, but these deities were behaving so strangely, which was really unbearable. "What do you mean be cautious? At worst, we'll just damage an avatar body and get a new one. I don't understand your attitude."</p><p></p><p>"What, you all want others to go first while you watch from behind, right? You want to imitate that coward Lord Eternal, right? Or shall I withdraw and you all can do it yourselves?"</p><p></p><p>The main deity Salvation God - Hundred Bodies immediately tried to mediate, "Red Light, what you said is correct, but the other deities' caution is also understandable. How about this - we spread out and surround them in formation to support each other. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>"That's excellent!"</p><p></p><p>Then the deities reorganized into a new formation and advanced. As they proceeded, they suddenly felt an overwhelming pressure on their bodies and the surrounding scene changed.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Before they could figure out what happened, they felt immobilized, as if bound by a powerful sealing soul technique.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a warm flow rushed madly into their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The deities realized they were under attack and were greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"It must be those old dragons playing tricks, waiting for this moment!"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, they immediately used their skills.</p><p></p><p>'Break Seal'!</p><p></p><p>"It's effective!"</p><p></p><p>'Seal Breaking Technique' 'Unseal Spell'...!</p><p></p><p>Soon they discovered something ominous - their connection to their main bodies was severed.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were puzzled and trying various soul techniques, their connection to the main body was restored.</p><p></p><p>The deities were perplexed - did their soul techniques work?</p><p></p><p>The information exchange between the main body and avatar was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, they understood their predicament.</p><p></p><p>"It seems...not looking good."</p><p></p><p>After Suhao swiftly brought the eleven deities into his small world, he immediately recorded the avatar information, analyzed the main body locations, then exited the small world and entered the 'Starry Network'. He locked onto the locations of the eleven deities' main bodies.</p><p></p><p>What followed was repeated 'Teleportation' 'Teleportation' 'Teleportation'...</p><p></p><p>He brought the dazed main bodies of the deities all into the small world.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, the avatar body above Dragon Continent looked into the distance and thought, "It seems two deities got away, but since I've discovered them, can they really escape?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Night God - Eternal and the Golden God - Barry met up after fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Barry was puzzled, "Lord Eternal, is it okay for us to just run away like this?"</p><p></p><p>Eternal looked at Barry uncomprehendingly, "Why not?"</p><p></p><p>Barry said, "It's right to let others go first to probe the situation, but doing it so blatantly seems too much. I think we should have done it secretly."</p><p></p><p>Eternal smiled wryly, "Whether blatant or secret, it's essentially no different, as long as the goal is achieved. Don't get hung up on formalities. Anyway, there's not much I care about."</p><p></p><p>Barry said helplessly, "Lord Eternal, you're right. If I cared, I wouldn't have run out here. I'm just curious what tricks those five old dragons are playing. But it's good to be cautious. Should we just wait here now?"</p><p></p><p>Eternal nodded, "Wait."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, they suddenly sensed the aura of the human deities disappearing in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The two were startled.</p><p></p><p>Barry exclaimed in surprise, "The aura just vanished."</p><p></p><p>Eternal frowned, "Perhaps they encountered what we did before."</p><p></p><p>Barry hesitated, "I didn't expect the other deities to be helpless against that inexplicable method too. What should we do now? Go check it out or go back and discuss?"</p><p></p><p>Eternal used his ability to control biological vision to observe the situation in the distance but found nothing unusual. He could only say, "Let's leave first!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, the two deities felt an overwhelming pressure and the scene changed.</p><p></p><p>Eternal and Barry: "???"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, eighteen complete Avatar Plates neatly collected, without a single one missing!"</p><p></p><p>After a series of troubles, Suhao finally collected the main bodies of all eighteen deities into his small world, achieving the 'Collect Deities' accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>There were some minor hiccups along the way, but the predetermined goal was perfectly completed.</p><p></p><p>To avoid explaining individually, he isolated the deities in a separate small space where they couldn't attack each other. He then gathered them together so they could communicate with each other, and left them alone.</p><p></p><p>He would wait for these deities to calm down completely before addressing them.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he teleported back to the Dragon Mother Shaduo and said, "Mother Shaduo, I have captured the deities of both humans and mountain clans, eighteen deities in total, neatly collected. With this, we no longer need to worry about the dragon race facing extinction. After some commotion outside, they will naturally disperse on their own."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mother Shaduo: "What...what? You captured the human deities too?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Of course, it took me quite some effort, but I succeeded in the end."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mother Shaduo was stunned, her mind in a mess. "That means..."</p><p></p><p>She couldn't say anything, completely unable to imagine that among the children she gave birth to, there was actually a deity terminator.</p><p></p><p>Was this little dragon hatchling in front of her really the same adorable one that had just emerged from the eggshell?</p><p></p><p>Two little dragon hatchlings came out and overheard their conversation. Curious, they asked, "Third Brother, why did you capture the deities? To roast and eat? Can you share some with us?"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Wind Cheng contacted Yashan with his assistant, "Big Boss Yashan, I'm currently in a place called Salvation City, said to be the most prosperous in this world. But after looking around, this is completely an extremely backward cult city with none of the things we want. The people here are also very dull-witted, like they're uncivilized. I'm afraid it will be of no use for our construction."</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked, "I'm on another continent and the situation is similar, with only some mineral information. The civilization in this world has extremely low exploitation of nature. It seems we need to capture enough labor force to rebuild."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng said, "That's the only way. I've heard that soul masters possess great power and are the best for labor. Most soul masters have gone to Dragon Continent for some deity war, so perhaps we can find enough manpower there."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Then let's head back to Dragon Continent to find workers and capture some dragons too."</p><p></p><p>After a casual discussion, the two decided to return to Dragon Continent to capture labor and dragons.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the world's deities mysteriously disappeared, even the divine envoys vanished without a trace, and the powerful soul masters and soul guardians were almost completely gone.</p>

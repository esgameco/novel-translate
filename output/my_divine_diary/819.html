        <h1>Chapter 819</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After following the mother dragon into the latter half of the channel, Su Hao clearly noticed that the latter half was different from the first half: these pirates had actually learned cooperation and strategy.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Mother Dragon Shadu, the pirates here seem better than those in the first half, with quite a few level 7 soul cultivators and soul guards. There are even a good number of mountain elf tribe members, could it be that the mountain elf tribe has a good relationship with humans?"</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shadu said, "Compared to the relationship with giant dragons, the relationship between humans and the mountain elf tribe would be better. It's just that the physically weaker races pity each other. After all, the lifespan of a giant dragon can reach over a thousand years, while the humans and mountain elves only live less than a hundred years. We giant dragons disdain to associate with those two races."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought silently, "So this is why humans and mountain elves are so eager to capture young dragons...a bunch of soul cultivators waiting for the young dragon's body to be reborn, to gain a long life! The innate inequality between the two races, it's strange their relationship could be good. And it's only natural that the giant dragons have developed this nasty 'strike first' personality."</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shadu continued, "Let's find an uninhabited place to rest. We won't stay on the small island for too long. If those soul cultivators don't rashly enter the safety zone we designate, we can ignore them. But if we discover they have designs on us, then we'll take the initiative to kill the enemy."</p><p></p><p>After carefully sensing it, Su Hao said, "Mother Dragon Shadu, these powerful soul cultivators seem prepared, as if planning to ambush us after we land."</p><p></p><p>When the mother dragon Shadu heard this, how could she accept it? She immediately said, "Lei'an, my child, those evil humans and mountain elves actually dare to set their sights on us. Then we'll kill them preemptively. As long as you kill the pity and hesitation in your heart, your future life will become very good."</p><p></p><p>Level 7 soul cultivators and soul guards were the limit ordinary people could reach in cultivating soul power. On his journey, he hadn't encountered many level 7 soul cultivators. Now that he had finally run into a few, it seemed a bit of a pity to directly kill them. It would be better to capture them first and study them when he had time.</p><p></p><p>After all, the ones he currently had imprisoned were just the small fry level 3-4 soul guards from the Rich Gold Squad - nothing worth mentioning. He had already drained their soul techniques dry.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Su Hao said to the mother dragon Shadu, "Mother Shadu, after a month of training, my 'Hundred Strikes, Hundred Hits' has become even stronger. Shall I demonstrate how?"</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shadu exclaimed happily, "This ability can become even stronger? Has it become longer range, more powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head, "Neither, let me demonstrate, watch closely."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he flickered and disappeared from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shadu: "Lei'an...??? Is this...invisibility?"</p><p></p><p>But she could no longer sense Su Hao on her back.</p><p></p><p>She turned to ask the two bewildered young dragons, "Chipu, Moli, have you two seen your brother Lei'an?"</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons shook their heads, "No."</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shadu asked, "Chipu, why are you blinking your eyes so frequently? Are your eyes uncomfortable?"</p><p></p><p>Even giant dragons could get sick, and she was worried her child had fallen ill after passing through the Heavenly Channel.</p><p></p><p>But Chipu said in a childish voice, "Mother Shadu, I'm practicing Brother Three's 'Hundred Strikes, Hundred Hits - Disappear' ability."</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shadu curiously asked, "What does that have to do with blinking your eyes?"</p><p></p><p>Chipu said, "Mother Shadu, you don't understand. It's my secret, I'll tell you after I master it."</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shadu: "......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Su Hao had already appeared before the three pirate gang leaders. But as he was always polite, before taking action he still asked about their intentions, "Are you here to capture me?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly appearing was a red-golden dragon, scaring the three pirate leaders and their subordinates, making their hair stand on end as they instinctively took a step back.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Su Hao's young dragon appearance, a blazing flame flashed in their eyes. Exchanging glances, they pounced towards Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, this is a young dragon, brothers, come grab it with me!"</p><p></p><p>"The young dragon is mine, don't fight me for it!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't crowd, don't crowd, there's enough for everyone...ah~"</p><p></p><p>Without needing their answer, Su Hao already knew.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step back, he then opened the entrance to his small world and placed it in front of himself.</p><p></p><p>The pirates rushed in like fish into a trap, scrambling to enter Su Hao's small world first.</p><p></p><p>Those with red eyes tempted by the young dragon's body rushed in themselves. The slightly more sober subordinate pirates following behind had never seen such a scene before.</p><p></p><p>As they ran, their legs went weak and they knelt before Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>These were just small fry level 3-4 subordinates, but Su Hao didn't look down on them. With a wave of his hand, he transmitted them all into the small world.</p><p></p><p>"Got it done, quite a big haul."</p><p></p><p>Sweeping with his spiritual sense, he locked onto the mother dragon Shadu's location and flickered over.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao suddenly appeared on the mother dragon's back, startling the three red-golden dragons.</p><p></p><p>The eldest dragon Chipu came over and blinked frantically at Su Hao. The second sister Moli circled behind Su Hao and stretched out her claws to pinch his tail, confirming he was a real dragon.</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shadu, worried yet pleasantly surprised, asked in astonishment, "Lei'an, my child, where were you hiding just now?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I was demonstrating my 'Hundred Strikes, Hundred Hits' ability to Mother Dragon Shadu. This is a new ability I awakened recently. I found the path to transfer attacks. Just now I followed the 'Hundred Strikes, Hundred Hits' path to attack those vicious pirates."</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shadu was stunned for a moment, then instinctively asked, "Were the pirates successfully eliminated?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Of course. Not a single one left."</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shadu's intelligent mind didn't know how to process this for a while. Finally she praised, "Lei'an, my child, you are indeed worthy of being a variant golden dragon...too powerful."</p><p></p><p>What she thought was, "The legendary variant golden dragon doesn't seem to have such powerful abilities? Could it be that Lei'an is the strongest super variant golden dragon born by chance in our golden dragon tribe? As long as Lei'an grows up smoothly, he will definitely become the strongest giant dragon under the two Dragon God Majesties."</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shadu struggled to accept the fact that her third child's 'Hundred Strikes, Hundred Hits' had advanced so much, and flew towards the island.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Inside the small world, the members of the Rich Gold Squad stared dumbfounded as a huge opening suddenly appeared in one corner, and a crowd of red-eyed people rushed in, jostling and shouting while brandishing weapons and chains. They tumbled into a heap.</p><p></p><p>"Who are these people? The aura they're giving off is so strong, we're definitely no match for them."</p><p></p><p>"What...what's going on? Where's Captain Xibo? Quick, go find Captain Xibo!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, find Captain Xibo!"</p><p></p><p>"Um...I think I just saw Captain Xibo and Weiya go into that little room alone."</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Someone asked foolishly, "What did those two go into the room for? Quick, go call them out!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's minds jumped to the same question: "Call them, or not call them?"</p><p></p><p>But in their panic, they couldn't think too much about it and ran towards the little hut they had built, shouting, "Captain Xibo, hurry out, there's a huge situation..."</p><p></p><p>The burly, bearded Xibo came out of the hut cursing as he tied his pants, "Damn it, what the hell, who's yelling so loudly and scaring me half to death. What big deal could there possibly be here?"</p><p></p><p>The squad members rushed to the burly Xibo and someone curiously asked, "How come Weiya didn't come out?"</p><p></p><p>*SMACK!*</p><p></p><p>The squad member who asked was kicked by Xibo, "Screw off, what Weiya, I don't know what you're talking about. What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The squad members pulled him to a higher vantage point and pointed to the distance, "Captain Xibo, look over there, other people have come in. They don't look easy to deal with - I can sense there are many level 5-6 soul guards from other sects."</p><p></p><p>Captain Xibo squinted and gazed for a moment, his expression quickly freezing.</p><p></p><p>His mind raced, the first thing he thought of was the only female squad member, and he barked, "Quick, dig a hole and hide Weiya away. Remember this, whoever exposes Weiya, I'll personally twist their head off."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Captain."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, after the three pirate gangs rushed into the small world, they discovered the young dragon had disappeared, leaving them dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They searched left and right but couldn't find it. Realizing they had entered an unfamiliar environment, they gradually calmed down: "What is this place?"</p><p></p><p>The three pirate leaders turned to look behind them and saw an opening through which people kept pouring in. Their expressions changed drastically as they shouted, "Quick, retreat!"</p><p></p><p>Punching out, they forcibly opened a path through the jostling crowd and rushed towards the exit.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late.</p><p></p><p>The opening slowly closed, eventually disappearing completely. No matter how they attacked the spatial walls of the small world, it had no effect.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the three pirate leaders gathered together, accusing each other.</p><p></p><p>"We've been had, what's going on? Was it you two playing tricks?"</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit, don't randomly blame us. I think it's you two colluding to monopolize the young dragon."</p><p></p><p>"You want to fight?"</p><p></p><p>"Bring it on, who's afraid of who!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After they calmed down, they noticed the Rich Gold Squad and others on the other side.</p><p></p><p>"They must be involved, let's go talk to them."</p>

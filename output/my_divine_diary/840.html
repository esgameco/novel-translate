        <h1>Chapter 840</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Nati had just finished saying there would be a surprise, before the two deities could understand what it was, they suddenly felt a huge amount of information rushing in, intersecting and overlapping. After a moment, they were still connected to their main bodies, but had transitioned from their original two minds into the independent mind they have now.</p><p></p><p>In that instant when their information converged, the two deities quickly realized one thing: their main bodies seemed to have been captured.</p><p></p><p>Suspended in mid-air were two differently shaped ten-colored tablets floating left and right. They were the main bodies of the God of Thunder - Gu and the Goddess of Beauty - Ful'er, which Suhao had captured and brought back at top speed.</p><p></p><p>Shock, confusion, bewilderment, fear...</p><p></p><p>Various complex emotions welled up in the two deities' hearts, eventually condensing into one word - run.</p><p></p><p>The two deities then activated the unique escape skill 'Teleportation' of the ten-colored tablets. A few seconds later, they turned into streams of light shooting towards their chosen directions.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Suhao's figure appeared in this small space, seeing the two newly joined deities not yet adapted to their new lives, running around everywhere. He couldn't be bothered to explain everything to them from the start.</p><p></p><p>He casually set up a spatial structure, isolating the three deities separately to prevent them from fighting and devouring each other. Then he said to the excited Nati: "Nati, you should properly explain the rules here to these two deities, at least make the rules clear, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Nati laughed heartily: "Rest assured, leave the Thunder Lord to me. I will make your requirements crystal clear."</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually responded, then left.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Suhao left, the two deities who thought they had run millions of miles finally ended their 'Teleportation' skill. The streams of light coalesced back into the ten-colored tablet main bodies.</p><p></p><p>The God of Thunder - Gu appeared more rugged, mainly blue and purple, while the Goddess of Beauty - Ful'er appeared more delicate and petite, mainly green and red.</p><p></p><p>After the two deities stopped, they found that despite flying for a long time, they were still in the original small space, as if they had never moved at all, leaving them completely baffled.</p><p></p><p>An ominous feeling pervaded their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively, the God of Thunder released his most powerful soul technique.</p><p></p><p>'Realm of Myriad Thunders'!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was no such thing as the outside world in this cyclic miniature world. The originally dozens-of-miles-wide thunderstorm was compressed and concentrated into the small space, almost turning the entire area into a world of plasma.</p><p></p><p>But it was useless, not improving the God of Thunder - Gu's predicament at all.</p><p></p><p>As the thunderstorm gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a hearty laugh came from the side. The two deities turned to look, and it was none other than Nati's dragon avatar.</p><p></p><p>The God of Thunder - Gu's main body spoke: "Nati, this must be your conspiracy and trickery! The so-called new god 'God of Secrets' spoken of by humans was all schemed by you in secret, wasn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Nati spread his hands: "I do not have the ability to bring the main bodies of two deities here."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty - Ful'er said: "Lord Nati, what is going on?"</p><p></p><p>Nati's main body slowly floated over, presenting itself before the two deities: "This is the first time we meet so candidly."</p><p></p><p>Gu and Ful'er were shocked: "Lord Nati, your main body is here too?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After leaving the miniature world, Suhao did not go elsewhere, but transmitted himself to Mother Dragon Shaduo's side.</p><p></p><p>He thought it necessary to explain to Mother Dragon Shaduo his reasons for taking the deities away, lest she start imagining all sorts of things.</p><p></p><p>When Suhao appeared, he found Mother Dragon Shaduo was flying out of the Dragon Continent with two dragon cubs. Without hesitation, he flashed over and sat on her back, chatting with her as usual.</p><p></p><p>"Mother Shaduo, where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing him, Mother Dragon Shaduo turned her head. Seeing Suhao, she showed a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>She immediately said: "Leian, you're back! That's great. We have offended three deity lords, so we must quickly leave the Dragon Continent, otherwise the three lords will surely kill us blasphemers. Leian, don't wander around anymore, come flee with us. I will protect you all."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Mother Shaduo, we haven't offended the three deity lords! There's no need to leave the Dragon Continent."</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo gave him a look of disbelief: "Leian, don't keep fooling around about such a critical matter. The three deity lords suddenly disappeared, it must be because you used your abilities on them. Leian, you're my child, you can't fool me. I've told you not to be disrespectful to the deities, but you didn't listen..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao readily admitted: "I did use my abilities on the deities, but it's not a problem. I've already captured and confined them. They can't do anything to me."</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo: "Leian, my child, the deities are immortal. We ordinary golden dragons can never contend with deities no matter how powerful we are. I should have realized, being born with immense power, you were bound to bring disaster due to your arrogance."</p><p></p><p>Knowing he couldn't convince the stubborn Mother Dragon Shaduo, Suhao said: "Mother Shaduo, let me take you to see those deities I've captured. Once you see them, you'll understand."</p><p></p><p>After stabilizing Mother Shaduo and the two cubs, he transmitted them all into the miniature world. The first thing Mother Shaduo saw was her most revered Deity Lord Nati.</p><p></p><p>The soul imprint in her mind gave her an overwhelming spiritual suggestion to immediately prostrate herself before the Deity Lord Nati.</p><p></p><p>Suhao coldly said to Nati: "Lord Nati, this is my Mother Shaduo."</p><p></p><p>The Deity Lord Nati froze: the mother of the unknown, powerful being who made him an experimental subject was his own servant and believer...</p><p></p><p>This was a bit messy. Nati felt he needed to sort out the relationships again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Within a couple of days, under Suhao's threats and Nati's persuasion, the God of Thunder - Gu and Goddess of Beauty - Ful'er compromised.</p><p></p><p>However, the stubborn God of Thunder - Gu made one demand: "I have two deputy gods under me. If Lord Leian can bring my two deputy gods here too, then I will unconditionally cooperate with your experiments."</p><p></p><p>Ful'er was dumbstruck, saying incredulously: "Gu, have you gone mad? They are the last two deities of our dragon race. If we lose even the last two deities, the entire dragon race will soon be exterminated by humans. Yet you make this demand?"</p><p></p><p>The God of Thunder - Gu said indifferently: "If I die, it doesn't matter whether the dragon race exists or not."</p><p></p><p>Nati and Ful'er could hardly believe Gu was such a dragon.</p><p></p><p>Suhao readily agreed, as he wholeheartedly welcomed having more experimental subjects.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, following Gu's enthusiastic guidance, Suhao easily found the avatars of the two deputy gods and dragged out their well-hidden main bodies.</p><p></p><p>These two deities were the Storm God - Anji and Dream God - Qiao of the Black Thunder Dragon Tribe.</p><p></p><p>The Storm God - Anji and Dream God - Qiao were even more confused: "We were just staying at home, how did we suddenly end up here? Oh? The other dragon deity lords are here too, what a coincidence. Should we go greet them..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two deities' bewildered expressions, the God of Thunder - Gu felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he confirmed one thing: before understanding Leian Oakes' means, perhaps all the deities combined would not be Leian Oakes' match.</p><p></p><p>With this realization, he had no qualms about obediently cooperating, only fearing that Leian might go back on his word and devour all the deities in one go...</p><p></p><p>The God of Thunder - Gu muttered to himself: "Since all the dragon deities are here, how can the human deities not come? I need to find a way to lure the human deities in too. Oh right, the three mountain spirit deities can't be left out either..."</p><p></p><p>In his view, it would be best if all deities were captured by Leian, not a single one left out.</p><p></p><p>That would only be fair!</p><p></p><p>The human deities were extremely vigilant, with all their senses open, constantly on guard against any possible sudden attacks from the dragon deities.</p><p></p><p>However, after these deities wandered the Dragon Continent for two to three days, not a single dragon servant or deity came out to stop them.</p><p></p><p>The deities were at a loss for a while, eventually gathering together to discuss countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had planned that their deity avatars would wander the Dragon Continent under the pretext of searching for the God of Secrets. The five dragon deities would surely come out to stop them, at which point they could justifiably launch a righteous war and invade the Dragon Continent.</p><p></p><p>But never did they expect that after wandering the continent for three days, not a single person paid them any mind. Aside from the ancestral grounds teeming with dragons, the rest of the vast continent was eerily quiet. Not a single deity or dragon servant in sight.</p><p></p><p>The human deities thought to themselves: "The selfish and insidious dragon race actually didn't follow the script? They must be hiding somewhere, probably watching us make fools of ourselves."</p><p></p><p>After much discussion, the Sun God Yi proposed: "Let's just proceed to the second step! Once we launch an all-out war against the dragon race, they can't hide anymore. If they still don't show up, we'll just exterminate the entire dragon race."</p>

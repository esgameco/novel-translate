        <h1>Chapter 740</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>More than twenty years ago, the Compound Eye race was threatened by the Eight-Armed race and had no choice but to seek help from humans.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Su Hao's advice to Xia Qingjun was to agree to the Compound Eyes' request, but with preconditions - their home planet must open up to humans and establish a connected teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun had no intention of defying Su Hao's wishes, and did not disappoint Su Hao. He successfully connected to the Compound Eyes' home planet, exposing the previously mysterious race to human view.</p><p></p><p>The Compound Eyes were extremely reluctant, but under the pressure of being enslaved and exterminated by the Eight-Armed race, they made many demands of the humans before agreeing to Xia Qingjun's plan to "establish a passage, deploy defenses, and fight against the Eight-Armed race."</p><p></p><p>After all, they were not afraid of humans. If pushed to the brink, they would steal human technology and hand it over to the Eight-Armed race, resulting in mutual destruction!</p><p></p><p>Ahem! Although many years have passed, and their blue lights have been watching humans closely, they haven't succeeded in stealing anything, but the Compound Eyes say they will keep trying.</p><p></p><p>So what exactly do the Compound Eyes look like?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also never had time to pay attention to such things, so he didn't know what the Compound Eyes looked like either.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until he concealed his form and teleported to the Compound Eyes' home planet via a positioning stone that he saw their appearance with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Compound Eyes are generally about one meter tall, with blue and yellow bodies.</p><p></p><p>They have a very peculiar appearance - long arms and short legs, looking plump overall. Their heads resemble mushroom caps, with a long tail extending from the back ending in a bud-like structure.</p><p></p><p>It looks just like an official's hat from the Qing Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>When those short legs run, that long tail sways back and forth like a leopard's tail, helping them keep their balance.</p><p></p><p>Overall, they look like...</p><p></p><p>Mushroom people?</p><p></p><p>But where are the "compound eyes" that the Compound Eye race is named for?</p><p></p><p>Those two round, cat-like eyes on the mushroom cap head?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could hardly believe that such a bizarre-looking race could have vision capable of piercing through vast star systems to accurately observe minute events happening in distant locations.</p><p></p><p>Concealed in the second-level space, Su Hao observed this peculiar race in their simple settlement on the Compound Eyes' home planet.</p><p></p><p>A few plump, blue, long-tailed mushroom creatures scurried past, making crisp "lili lili" sounds from under their mushroom cap heads.</p><p></p><p>It sounded quite lighthearted and happy.</p><p></p><p>Under Su Hao's gaze, the Compound Eye in the lead tripped over its own feet and suddenly fell flat. The ones behind couldn't stop in time and tumbled into a heap, letting out a series of crisp shrieks.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao slowly formed a question mark: "This? An intelligent race?"</p><p></p><p>After strolling around the settlement, he still didn't see any of the Compound Eyes observing the universe, so he thought to himself, "Could it be that I was mistaken, and these little guys aren't actually the Compound Eye race?"</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment, then contacted Feng Cheng: "Feng Cheng, go get information about the Compound Eye race from the captain, including their appearance, living habits, language and writing, etc. I need it."</p><p></p><p>"Got it, Master Su, just wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>After assigning the task, Su Hao began wandering around this planet filled with peculiar creatures.</p><p></p><p>He then discovered a very strange phenomenon - the vast majority of lifeforms on this planet were very docile, with few ferocious predators.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, many animals had tails similar to the mushroom people, with a bud-like structure at the end.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao guessed, "Could the so-called 'compound eyes' be those buds on the tails?"</p><p></p><p>After wandering around, Su Hao finally couldn't resist taking action.</p><p></p><p>He stealthily dragged a slowly crawling, long-tailed blue creature into the second-level world.</p><p></p><p>Pouring raging bloodlust energy into the long-tailed blue creature's body, he recorded its physical structure, then entered the Bouncing Realm to carefully observe this creature's body structure.</p><p></p><p>This series of actions left the poor blue creature dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Its meager brain simply could not comprehend why it had suddenly arrived in this strange place when it was just about to find a mate. It was in a total panic!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After examining the blue creature's body structure, Su Hao couldn't help but furrow his brow.</p><p></p><p>Although this creature's physical and cellular structures were different from anything he had seen before, Su Hao could confirm that it was just an ordinary lifeform.</p><p></p><p>Even the bud-like structure at the end of its tail, which looked the most peculiar, was clearly analyzed by him.</p><p></p><p>The structure did resemble a bud that could bloom, containing abundant nerve cells inside, but it had no eye-like structures at all.</p><p></p><p>It was far more likely that this was a reproductive organ rather than "compound eyes" that could gaze into distant space.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought, "It seems that to figure out what's going on, I'll need to capture some of these mushroom Compound Eyes and run some experiments on them. It would be best if I could learn about the secrets of their compound eyes through communication."</p><p></p><p>He withdrew from the Bouncing Realm and teleported back to the Compound Eyes' home planet, hiding in the second-level space and looking for an opportunity to capture a few of them.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Feng Cheng's message arrived, along with a large file package.</p><p></p><p>"Master Su, the information you requested is all in the file package, organized by category. Please take a look and let me know if anything is missing, and I'll go ask the captain for more."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao replied, "Got it!"</p><p></p><p>After completing the task, Feng Cheng muttered to himself, "How did the captain know I like girls? He actually invited me to go find a girl... I almost agreed. It's a good thing I held back - studying is still more enjoyable..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao opened the files and browsed through them. It didn't take long for him to finish reading.</p><p></p><p>The Compound Eyes were indeed those one-meter tall, blue mushroom people. Their living habits were basically consistent with Su Hao's own observations.</p><p></p><p>Their food requirements were not high, they grew very slowly, and could live up to over six hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The bud-like structure at the end of their tails was a unique biological organ on the Compound Eyes' home planet. Based on years of observation, humans guessed it was related to the Compound Eyes' powerful intelligence-gathering abilities.</p><p></p><p>Aside from that, humans had no deeper understanding. The Compound Eyes had done very thorough confidentiality work regarding this.</p><p></p><p>The tail buds seemed to be a secret they could not let outsiders know about.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought about it, then still decided to try capturing a few first.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I move fast enough, even the Compound Eyes won't be able to observe my existence. On such a large planet, a few missing Compound Eyes is perfectly normal."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao found a small Compound Eye village with a relatively low population. With his divine sense extending out and Equilibrium Technique layered on top, in the blink of an eye he teleported all the Compound Eyes in the village into the second-level world.</p><p></p><p>A total of ninety Compound Eyes stood dazed, blinking their eyes as they observed their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Where were their houses? Their village? It had just disappeared into thin air!</p><p></p><p>Puzzled and confused!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a few naked Compound Eyes covered their lower regions and let out shrill screams.</p><p></p><p>The other Compound Eyes, who hadn't noticed before, now turned to look.</p><p></p><p>Oh my! Naked is quite a sight.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Compound Eyes suddenly realized they were facing an unprecedented situation.</p><p></p><p>Panic and fear!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pondered for a moment, then took on the form of a ferocious dragon monster and slowly revealed himself.</p><p></p><p>He then opened his mouth and let out a earth-shaking roar towards the Compound Eyes: "Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Compound Eyes froze, then turned to see an enormous, hideous monster towering over them.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies instantly went numb, trembling as if struck by lightning.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, they let out shrill screams again and scattered in all directions, even more exaggerated than before.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought, "These Compound Eyes don't seem to handle being scared very well! I need to make them calm down a bit."</p><p></p><p>Then he stretched out a claw and tapped.</p><p></p><p>'Body Binding Technique'!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took a step forward, making 'boom boom' sounds.</p><p></p><p>The Compound Eyes' large eyes were filled with terror as they kept looking up at Su Hao, letting out intermittent shrill screams.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after struggling in vain, they resigned themselves and closed their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stretched out his claw and hooked one of the little mushroom people, bringing it up to his face.</p><p></p><p>That mushroom person suddenly felt itself being lifted into the air, and couldn't help but open its eyes, immediately seeing an enormous, ferocious head.</p><p></p><p>"Ahli——"</p><p></p><p>It peed itself out of fright!</p>

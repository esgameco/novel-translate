        <h1>Chapter 622</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In just a short month, disasters decreased sharply worldwide. Except for some high-level members of mage associations, almost no one was aware of the severity of the situation.</p><p></p><p>For most mages, the reduction in disasters was an extremely common occurrence - the number of disasters each day was never the same, there were always fluctuations up and down. </p><p></p><p>Especially in winter, disasters seemed to need to hibernate as well, with numbers dropping significantly.</p><p></p><p>Many people thought the current abnormality was just temporary, that things would return to normal after some time, and they could take this opportunity to rest well at home for a while.</p><p></p><p>But after resting, they were destined to have no chance to go back to work.</p><p></p><p>After another two months, the number of disasters still had not recovered to the usual average level, not only that, but they had almost disappeared completely!</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying statistic - even during low periods, the number of sudden disasters worldwide each day would not be less than 500,000!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps disasters were like life itself, also subject to being 'born, aging, sickness and death'!</p><p></p><p>They were initially delighted in their hearts, a feeling of parting the clouds to see the blue sky washed over them, body and mind refreshed and bright!</p><p></p><p>But quickly it turned into deep worry: "If there are no more disasters, then I will have no way to obtain source pearls? Without source pearls, what will I use to activate my abilities? Without source pearls, what is the difference between me, a source mage, and an ordinary person?"</p><p></p><p>Then thinking about their own source pearl savings, there were not many left. Not only not many, it seemed they even owed Old Wang next door more than a dozen low-quality source pearls...</p><p></p><p>It was just like a migrant worker toiling for ten years, failing to save a single cent, but instead ending up in deep debt.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p>"I'm out of source pearls!"</p><p></p><p>Many people gradually reacted, wanting to use money to buy source pearls, but it was already too late - source pearl prices had been driven up to astronomical levels, with limited supply.</p><p></p><p>Those were source pearls after all, no matter how many, never enough - no one was willing to easily sell them.</p><p></p><p>It was at this time that everyone had the same doubt in their minds: "What exactly is going on?"</p><p></p><p>Many source mages traveled far to New Era City, finding the high-level members of the Mage Association to inquire about the situation.</p><p></p><p>The mage said solemnly: "Our world is about to face an unprecedented change in ten thousand years. No one can be spared, no one can change it. All we can do is unite wholeheartedly and do our utmost to deal with the 'greater disaster' to come!"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss--"</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone gasped in cold air.</p><p></p><p>What is this 'greater disaster'?</p><p></p><p>They were terrified by their own thoughts!</p><p></p><p>Some began looking for the reason: Could it be because some time ago when the disasters first emerged, we directly extinguished them, going too far, angering the father of disasters?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, this did seem possible!</p><p></p><p>All kinds of speculations quickly spread around the world, everyone fearing for themselves.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In fact, the mage was more confused and panicked than anyone.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Jia Wei and the other two did something outrageously insane? This matter must be related to those three fellows!</p><p></p><p>But what exactly were those three trying to do? How did those three manage to make disasters almost disappear completely?</p><p></p><p>This was something the mage could never figure out no matter what! In his view, no one could possibly do this, except for the Creator - who else could?</p><p></p><p>The mage had been losing sleep over this, his worried expression making him look a few years older.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, had the mages of the Association collectively become unemployed?</p><p></p><p>Without mages going out daily to deal with disasters and obtain source pearls, the Mage Association's source of source pearls would be reduced by at least half!</p><p></p><p>The mage thought to himself: "Now the main source of source pearls relies on 'source devices' naturally converting them, but relying solely on source devices is absolutely unable to supply the huge daily consumption."</p><p></p><p>No wonder Jia Yashan told me to purchase and hoard a large amount of source pearls in advance - he had already anticipated today's events!</p><p></p><p>After much thought, the mage decided to ask Yashan to get to the bottom of this, otherwise he would be unable to get a good night's sleep, and at his advanced age, he might pass away at any time.</p><p></p><p>Yashan had also been waiting for the mage to come find him.</p><p></p><p>He smiled and said, "I didn't expect the Venerable Mage to be such a patient person, taking so long to come find me. You truly live up to being the leader of all the world's mages!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the mage almost couldn't help but smash his teacup in Yashan's face.</p><p></p><p>Is that how you speak? Doesn't he know who's been constantly complaining about being 'busy busy busy', unable to find time for so long!</p><p></p><p>He forced out a kindly smile and said, "Mr. Jia Yashan flatters me. If not for the many doubts leaving me unable to eat or sleep in peace, I would not have come to disturb your work."</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled, "Actually, the disappearance of disasters was done by us three."</p><p></p><p>The mage took a deep breath and calmly said, "I know that!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan raised his eyebrows, "Your information is that timely?"</p><p></p><p>The mage was temporarily speechless - did something so easy to guess require insider information? He asked instead, "What exactly did you all do? Why have disasters been receding worldwide? How did you manage to do it?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Explaining it to you would be pointless since you wouldn't understand anyway, so I won't bother."</p><p></p><p>The mage asked, "Will it return to normal in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Perhaps it will! Right now the disasters have been sealed by us. If the seal disappears, then the disasters will reemerge to invade this planet."</p><p></p><p>The mage heard the term "seal" for the first time and couldn't help but ask skeptically, "Sealed?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "That's not the main point! Rest assured, this is just the first step of our plan - to cut off the source supply to mages. Without source, mages can't do anything. The Mage Association will have to come out and coordinate to control the situation, while slowly changing mages' perceptions."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Yashan took out a book he had prepared long ago and handed it to the mage, saying, "This is the 'Tome of Forbidden Magic', divided into three parts - beginning, middle and end. The beginning records methods of magic cultivation, the middle records the magic language and spells, and the end records all kinds of magic from first circle to ninth circle!"</p><p></p><p>The mage took the book, completely baffled.</p><p></p><p>What is this stuff - magic? Spells? Circles? He had never heard of such things!</p><p></p><p>He flipped open the beginning, titled 'Meditation and Mana'...</p><p></p><p>The mage: "......"</p><p></p><p>He, an erudite scholar, was like an illiterate in front of Jia Wei and the other two.</p><p></p><p>"It's just as I told you before, the Mage Association must quickly complete its transformation, from the old mode of issuing tasks to becoming a top institution for imparting advanced knowledge.</p><p></p><p>You have to admit, a top institution for passing on knowledge is a place everyone aspires to."</p><p></p><p>Yashan explained a bit more to the dazed mage, then sent him off to study on his own first.</p><p></p><p>After the mage left, Yashan headed towards the mechanical workshop area to continue working on satellite propulsion devices.</p><p></p><p>As he walked, he laughed and muttered to himself, "The seed has been planted. Whether it can grow strong depends on you all!"</p><p></p><p>If this world did not develop according to his expectations and went astray...</p><p></p><p>Then Yashan would say he was not responsible!</p><p></p><p>He had provided everything - if they failed to make the most of it, who could be blamed?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 646</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The two were just recovering from their shock and nervously greeted him, "Teacher Feng Cheng!"</p><p></p><p>Although Feng Cheng had never taught these two students before, everyone in the astronomy group would address him as "teacher."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was surprised that despite the destruction of Planet Source, the two remained so calm.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask, "Do you know what happened to Planet Source?"</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other in confusion, "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>The observation station was positioned facing away from Planet Source, focused on observing the outer space around it. So these two were still unaware that Planet Source had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Instead of answering, Feng Cheng asked, "Do you have observation records of Planet Source?"</p><p></p><p>The man called Yuan Feng immediately said, "We have records. The 'Wind God Celestial Eye System' constantly records the movements of Planet Source, and all data is compiled here. Ling Xue, retrieve the data."</p><p></p><p>Ling Xue promptly operated the computer, pulling up various data while asking, "Teacher Feng Cheng, do you have a specific time period you want to look at?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "The data from the past two hours."</p><p></p><p>"One moment."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Feng Cheng sent a message in the group, "Master Wei, I have the corresponding data here!"</p><p></p><p>The next instant, Su Hao appeared beside Feng Cheng, startling the two observers again. Ya Shan also rushed over shortly after.</p><p></p><p>The two observers turned red with excitement, their hearts guessing, "Is this the 'Creator' Master Jia Wei that Teacher Feng Cheng mentioned? That armor is so cool! This is the person who can destroy planets!"</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the inner excitement of the two inexperienced observers, as soon as Su Hao arrived, he began examining the retrieved image data.</p><p></p><p>He first fast-forwarded through it, discovering that the disaster that destroyed Planet Source originated from the small island where their base's small world was previously located.</p><p></p><p>He pulled up the video of the small island, locked onto its position, and then played it back slowly.</p><p></p><p>In the footage, the small island and the surrounding sea water suddenly shook violently, forming an intense shockwave that radiated outwards.</p><p></p><p>The small island itself was shaken into powder, like a pile of flour, instantly blown away by the shockwave.</p><p></p><p>After a brief stillness, a dazzling white light shot out from the location of the small island, turning the entire display white for a long time before dissipating.</p><p></p><p>When the image gradually recovered, the small island had become an ocean of raging flames.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the flames rapidly spread outward from the small island as the center, engulfing the entire planet within half an hour, leaving nothing unscathed.</p><p></p><p>After watching, Su Hao basically understood what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's a system with me as the focus. However, this focal system seems unable to precisely lock onto my location, only able to roughly lock onto the area I frequent. Then a massive amount of energy converges here, causing a special 'calamity'."</p><p></p><p>Replaying that segment of video, Su Hao made a preliminary guess about this incident, "It can be confirmed that this 'calamity' locked onto the location of the small island.</p><p></p><p>The immense force gathered, instantly reducing the small island to powder. Even if I was on the island, if I wasn't prepared, I might have died directly. However, without actually experiencing it, I can't confirm the intensity.</p><p></p><p>As for the subsequent explosion, perhaps the underwater portion of the small island transformed into the source, and then further transformed into a tremendous energy release outwards.</p><p></p><p>The only puzzling part is why the explosion affected the entire planet within half an hour."</p><p></p><p>What truly destroyed this world was not the 'calamity system' that descended upon the small island, but the subsequent inexplicable chain reaction.</p><p></p><p>But what was it?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Su Hao pondered to himself, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng also curiously examined the video data. Feng Cheng even specifically pulled up the location of the Zoulemi Celestial Palace to see it consumed by the raging flames, letting out a regretful sigh, "What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the two small observers, Yuan Feng and Ling Xue, were dumbstruck!</p><p></p><p>They stood there like wooden chickens.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao was operating the video, they were standing beside him watching.</p><p></p><p>But what did they see?</p><p></p><p>This planet that nurtured countless lives had suddenly turned into a massive fireball, like the sun itself.</p><p></p><p>The end of the world?</p><p></p><p>This must be a dream!</p><p></p><p>They must have been manipulated by these powerful mages and unknowingly pulled into a nightmare constructed by them...</p><p></p><p>Yes! That must be it!</p><p></p><p>They tried all the "lucid dreaming" techniques they learned online in an attempt to break free from this terrible nightmare, but failed.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng and Ling Xue looked at each other. Yuan Feng tugged on Ling Xue's arm, and Ling Xue understood, saying to Feng Cheng, "Teacher Feng Cheng, we're going to take a walk around."</p><p></p><p>They said they were going for a walk, but in reality, they planned to go to the other side of this moon to see if their home planet had truly been burned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>They were confident that when it came to observing planets, even powerful mages couldn't deceive their eyes. At that time, one look would reveal the truth.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng just nodded and ignored the two observers.</p><p></p><p>After donning their equipment, Yuan Feng and Ling Xue entered the decompression chamber and slid along the moon's orbit toward the other side.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they saw the raging flames of Planet Source!</p><p></p><p>At a glance, they knew this was real. The rampant energy on the planet's surface was visibly turbulent and chaotic.</p><p></p><p>The red and yellow glow reflected on their faces, a wave of heat washing over them, as if bathed in sunlight.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng blankly said, "This is real. Our planet is burning!"</p><p></p><p>Ling Xue murmured in a daze, "How could this happen...does this mean we can't go home anymore?"</p><p></p><p>When they came on duty, everything was still fine. Now they can't return!</p><p></p><p>It seems their relatives and friends are gone too!</p><p></p><p>If asked about their feelings at this moment, they couldn't put it into words.</p><p></p><p>If asked to share their thoughts, they would probably just swear.</p><p></p><p>Their minds were buzzing now, unable to think about anything, having temporarily lost even the ability to grieve.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, Yuan Feng slowly recovered, strangely not losing composure. He subconsciously answered Ling Xue's question from long ago, "Indeed, it seems we can't go back! We may have to live on the moon from now on."</p><p></p><p>Ling Xue nodded blankly.</p><p></p><p>Lost in her dazed thoughts, Yuan Feng's pupils suddenly constricted as terror took over his mind, his whole body trembling.</p><p></p><p>He forcibly restrained his chattering teeth and asked in a low voice, "Ling Xue, do you think Planet Source was destroyed by Teacher Feng Cheng's boss, the Creator 'Jia Wei'?"</p><p></p><p>After all, in everyone's perception, only Su Hao had such ability.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xue shuddered, her mind and body also instantly gripped by fear. She subconsciously took two steps closer to Yuan Feng, seeking a sense of safety.</p><p></p><p>She could only shake her head, unable to say a word.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to know the truth.</p><p></p><p>But there was one question they couldn't understand: Why would Jia Wei destroy the world? Had someone offended him?</p><p></p><p>Then another question arose: Should they ask Jia Wei directly if he was the one who destroyed the world, and why he destroyed it?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lost in thought, Su Hao suddenly raised his head and said, "Let's go back to Planet Source and take a look! Perhaps I know why the 'calamity system's' energy eventually affected the entire planet!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng turned to Su Hao in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Master Wei is awesome! They hadn't figured out the whole story yet, but Master Wei had already cracked the case?</p><p></p><p>Without much thought, they followed Su Hao and flashed away.</p><p></p><p>The three flashed continuously, quickly returning to Planet Source, surrounded by raging energies.</p><p></p><p>Yet Su Hao seemed to ignore these energies, standing still in midair and focusing his mind to carefully sense the changes in the air around him.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Su Hao suddenly opened his eyes and said, "I see! The root cause was still created by me!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng: "???"</p>

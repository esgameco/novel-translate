        <h1>Chapter 717</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>For a very long time after that, Su Hao was studying the 'twin insect eggs' of the mother insect, while Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were studying the principles of the mother insect's superimposed neural system.</p><p></p><p>The three of them worked hard on the mother insect together, sharing research findings and data.</p><p></p><p>Limited by manpower shortage and the growth rate of the mother insect, their progress was not too fast, but not too slow overall either.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of his 'divine mind' and the bouncing ball space, Su Hao quickly locked onto the 'insect egg cultivation system' of the mother insect.</p><p></p><p>He brought in a large number of plump mother insects, separated them into small worlds, then fed them materials, observing the production process of their insect eggs from nothing to existence.</p><p></p><p>After two years of uninterrupted observation, Su Hao finally figured out the mechanism of the mother insect's 'twin insect eggs'!</p><p></p><p>"A trumpet vortex structure just like the energy blocks!"</p><p></p><p>It was beyond Su Hao's expectation, but also gave him a feeling of 'ah, so that's how it is!'</p><p></p><p>This made Su Hao absolutely certain that this cloud ring system, although it looked like countless galaxies in the universe, must also have its own special aspects.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, such miraculous energy blocks and star-eating insects would not have been born.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao guessed another possibility: "Or perhaps...every galaxy is like this? After all, this is only the first time I've had such a broad perspective. The worlds I've been to before were limited to within planets, and I had no ability to experience the true face of the vast universe."</p><p></p><p>It's not impossible that every galaxy is like this...</p><p></p><p>However, with only one sample now, it's impossible to draw accurate and useful conclusions. Even if there are conclusions, they would basically be one-sided.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao turned his attention back to the mother insect.</p><p></p><p>This special 'trumpet vortex structure' is the key for the mother insect to produce twin insect eggs.</p><p></p><p>The mother insect absorbs nutrients every moment, then shoots the decomposed special materials into the vortex at an extremely fast speed. The materials then rotate at high speed along a set orbit. The closer to the center of the vortex, the faster the speed. After going through a special screening mechanism, two similar particles are eventually squeezed together, forming a special entanglement phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>There are many trumpet vortex structures inside the mother insect's body. Every second, each vortex structure can obtain countless pairs of particles. These paired particles eventually combine into specific locations of the insect eggs, gradually developing into the insect's neural system, resulting in 'twin insect eggs'.</p><p></p><p>It sounds very simple, but the process is extremely complex!</p><p></p><p>Just like how it's hard for people to imagine how complex, hardworking, and effortful human cells are.</p><p></p><p>Even after witnessing the whole process, Su Hao still found it hard to imagine what kind of evolution the star-eating insects must have gone through to reach this level.</p><p></p><p>Human quantum communication technology can't even reach one percent of the mother insect's level!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao sighed: "How did the mother insect manage to do this? What other unknown secrets are hidden within life forms?"</p><p></p><p>After analyzing the mother insect's basic operating structure, he became even more interested in the mother insect. If he could also build a neural system with 'synchronization ability' like the mother insect...</p><p></p><p>'I have billions of avatars' would no longer just be an idea!</p><p></p><p>As long as there were enough avatars, perhaps he could then understand the appearance of the universe...</p><p></p><p>"Stop! I'll think about such things later. The key now is to decipher the mechanism of the mother insect's 'twin insect eggs'. Otherwise, everything is meaningless."</p><p></p><p>Anyone can fantasize, but taking steps that are too big may not be a good thing. All matters should proceed step-by-step, grounded in the present!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly adjusted his state and re-entered his research on the mother insect.</p><p></p><p>"Let's start by tackling how the mother insect matches similar particles! Five years is not enough, then ten years. Ten years is not enough, then twenty years...I'll definitely succeed in the research eventually! As for the Compound Eye race...no need to rush, they can't run away anytime soon."</p><p></p><p>He thought about it and felt a bit uneasy, so he sent a message in the group to the most idle Feng Cheng: "Feng Cheng, find some time to search for the Compound Eye race's home planet. I've marked the approximate range for you. If you find it, secretly leave one of my positioning stones on their planet."</p><p></p><p>Hearing there was a task, Feng Cheng immediately became excited and quickly replied: "Received, Captain Su!"</p><p></p><p>On Ya Shan's side, he also made new discoveries regarding the mother insect's neural structure and deciphered a kind of embedded neural structure more complex than ordinary creatures' brains.</p><p></p><p>He was currently trying to artificially combine the neural system on mother insect experimental subjects and planned to capture some octopus monsters for corresponding experiments.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the task of capturing was left to Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>As for the little girl Yong Hua, she was currently immersed in studying, unable to extricate herself!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Another year passed, and the captain found Su Hao again, asking in a low voice: "Big Hao, any progress in your studies and research recently?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao knew exactly what the captain meant without guessing and said directly: "Very smooth progress, and 'teleportation' has also been deciphered!"</p><p></p><p>The captain's eyes widened: "'Teleportation' has been researched?"</p><p></p><p>He was just going through the routine of asking, never expecting Su Hao to give him such a huge surprise.</p><p></p><p>Although he believed Su Hao would definitely succeed, when success was truly confirmed, an inexplicable feeling of wild joy filled his heart, making his whole body instantly numb, as if countless firecrackers were bursting open all over his body.</p><p></p><p>Next came disbelief!</p><p></p><p>For the captain, Su Hao's speed could indeed be described as 'effortless', because in just ten years, an epoch-making achievement was born.</p><p></p><p>This was something countless top scientists wouldn't even dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "What, doubting my research ability?"</p><p></p><p>"No..." The captain opened his mouth but couldn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao handed him a file and said, "It seems you don't believe me. Okay, let your people set up equipment in two places according to the structure in this file. After it's set up, tell me, and I'll come give you a personal test."</p><p></p><p>The captain took the hard drive Su Hao handed over, looking a bit dazed, and said, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>He held the hard drive like it was his lifeline, first putting it in his pocket, then taking it out thinking the pocket was unsafe, and hugging it to his chest...</p><p></p><p>Then he excitedly ran out of the small world to find the leader Xia Qingjun!</p><p></p><p>After learning the news, Xia Qingjun was excited but also a bit anxious. He paced back and forth, thinking about how to avoid the Compound Eye race's prying eyes and successfully complete the teleportation experiment.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how he thought about it, he couldn't completely avoid their gaze, so he slapped the table and said, "Arrange to set up the test immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Just ten days later, two huge teleportation arrays were set up!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao scanned them with his divine mind and found that the teleportation arrays were constructed exactly according to his design drawings, making him exceptionally attentive. With a smile, he said, "Okay, activate the energy block energy transmission on both sides of the teleportation arrays."</p><p></p><p>The staff followed his instructions and activated the equipment.</p><p></p><p>After the energy output from the energy blocks, it was converted into spiritual power by the spiritualization system, then input into the entire teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation array's patterns lit up with a faint white light, then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Once the teleportation array is activated, don't easily cut off the energy supply. Let it remain in a ready-to-activate state at all times. Because once it's cut off, it may become ineffective!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's words were immediately recorded verbatim by someone.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while and confirming that the teleportation arrays on both sides were successfully connected, he said, "So, who wants to try it out? Just stand inside the teleportation array, enter the corresponding array's serial number on the control panel, and confirm. The teleportation array will then activate automatically."</p><p></p><p>The captain immediately raised his hand: "Me!"</p><p></p><p>And he had to be the one to try it!</p>

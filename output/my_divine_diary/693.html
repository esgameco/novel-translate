        <h1>Chapter 693</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>When Su Hao finished loading the [Eight-Handed God] with the 'Transformation God Cultivator', the Remote Star finally arrived at the territory of the star-eating insects.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the broadcast of the Remote Star sounded, "In two hours, the ship will shut down the curvature engine, so please have all personnel enter the acclimatization chamber immediately to get ready."</p><p></p><p>Adaptation cabin Su Hao had ignored it long ago, that kind of buffer device for general ship soldiers was useless to him.</p><p></p><p>The small world that Su Hao was in was located within the dormitory, and when the announcement rang out, he immediately heard it.</p><p></p><p>He let go of the hand that was pressed on the [Eight Handed God], opened his eyes and muttered, ''Is it already here? I'm also somewhat interested in star-eating insects, so it's a good time to take this opportunity to catch some experimental subjects."</p><p></p><p>After knowing that this trip was the Star Eating Insect Starfield, he had deliberately looked up some information about Star Eating Insects and had a rough understanding of them.</p><p></p><p>But in itself, humans lacked sufficient understanding of this magical creature, and Su Hao didn't get much information.</p><p></p><p>It was only known that Star Eating Insects had many forms with different functions, such as 'beetle type', 'ant type', 'worm type', and 'flying dragon type. ' ......</p><p></p><p>The sizes varied, with the largest being as big as a battleship and the smallest being as small as a finger.</p><p></p><p>Their social structure is very simple, there is only one mother worm in a colony, and all the worms in the colony will act according to the instructions of the mother worm.</p><p></p><p>The reason why they are called 'Star Eating Bugs' is because once this kind of bug invades a planet with a not-so-harsh environment, it will destroy the structure of the planet in just fifty years, completely turning it into a paradise for Star Eating Bugs.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, after they had completely destroyed a planet, they would eject a large number of bug eggs into space, letting these bug eggs wander around the universe until they were captured by other planets. As long as one of the bug eggs falls into the planet, if there are no accidents, then the planet's end is destined to become another star-eating bug's paradise.</p><p></p><p>The star-eating bug eggs, on the other hand, have a standby length in space that, according to research predictions, is at least 10,000 years, up or down.</p><p></p><p>As for the star-eating bug's starfield, why is it a forbidden area for humans and races such as the eight-handed race, so that the powerful eight-handed race are afraid to step in easily, unable to build a signal base nest ......</p><p></p><p>It's simple, the star-eating bugs have existed for an unknown number of years, and it's impossible to calculate how many bug eggs have been ejected into space.</p><p></p><p>By now, the star field within a certain range has been densely covered with bug eggs ......</p><p></p><p>Any spacecraft that dares to break into this starfield will face these uncountable bug eggs.</p><p></p><p>Once attached by more than a certain number of bug eggs, the spacecraft would likely turn into a small paradise for the star-eating bugs.</p><p></p><p>The star-eating bugs were almost like a galactic virus, that's how terrifying it was, and the starfield where the bug eggs were scattered was known as the 'star-eating bug starfield'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao put away the information about the star-eating bugs, got up and came to the side of the [Eight-Handed God], secretly saying, ''The [Eight-Handed God] has already mastered a certain degree of spatial ability and has become a 'Transformation God Cultivator', which is considered to be a qualified surrogate walker.</p><p></p><p>Then, from now on, let's hide my main body in secondary space and use [Eight-Handed God] to move around outside!"</p><p></p><p>When the curvature engine stopped, Su Hao immediately hid his physical body into the 'secondary space' of the two small worlds, and his consciousness entered the pinball space, activating the 'full immersion control system' that controlled the [Eight-Handed God].</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the [Eight-Handed God] opened its eyes, and its body form gradually changed, finally turning into Xu Shiqiang's appearance.</p><p></p><p>He grinned and laughed out.</p><p></p><p>Putting on his clothes, he walked out of the small world.</p><p></p><p>Next, there was no need to act with any scruples!</p><p></p><p>Steady!</p><p></p><p>With his new body, Su Hao walked out of the dormitory, looking no different.</p><p></p><p>This body now also had a Harmonized God cultivation, and although the range of divine perception wasn't as exaggerated as Su Hao's main body's 200,000 meters, it was still 80,000 meters away, and for daily actions, it was completely sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the fact that the use of some spiritual power was not very skillful, the rest was very good.</p><p></p><p>Essentially, it was all 'invincible'.</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of divine thoughts, the scene of the entire ship was instantly reflected into perception.</p><p></p><p>He found that after confirming that they had entered the Star Eater starfield, the spirits of the people on board the Remote Star were all taut, and although they had not yet fully recovered from the negative state of shutting down the engines, they still insisted on guarding their positions and being vigilant of everything around them.</p><p></p><p>The space beyond the ship was dotted with countless star points in the black curtain, no different from the previous star field, so profound and silent.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his open divine mind caught a white dot that flashed by on the side of the airship.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>It looked like an ordinary meteorite, but it wasn't.</p><p></p><p>With a little concentration, he caught the speedy white dot.</p><p></p><p>It was white in color, the size of a basketball, ellipsoidal in shape, covered in dust, and looked as dusty as a dirty rugby ball.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the egg of a ...... star eater? It's only just broken out of the curvature sailing state, and you've encountered an insect egg?"</p><p></p><p>If it really is a bug egg, then the density of bug eggs in this star field can be imagined ......</p><p></p><p>The speed of the bug egg was very fast, and just as Su Hao wanted to capture the bug egg for study, he had just made a move, and the bug egg flickered away, out of Su Hao's range of perception.</p><p></p><p>But not long after, another one entered Su Hao's divine perception.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's eyes narrowed, and almost instantly, he calculated the trajectory of the insect egg, and then cast the Negative Space Module to accurately capture that insect egg.</p><p></p><p>Only reaching forward, a large white insect egg appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>With a casual shake, the cosmic dust accumulated on the worm egg was shaken off by him, revealing the crystalline jade-like texture of the worm egg.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment and walked towards the command center.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the command center was crowded with officers of all levels, discussing the current situation intensely.</p><p></p><p>"Just a moment ago, a probe has already detected the presence of a large number of high-speed flying bug eggs in the surrounding area. We have already entered the Star Eater Insect Starfield without a doubt."</p><p></p><p>"Are the signals back to normal now? Has it gotten rid of the Eight Hands' signal lock?"</p><p></p><p>"Five hours have passed since we broke away from the curvature voyage, and all current signals have returned to normal! There is a high probability that the Remote Star has successfully gotten rid of the Eight Hands' lock. In another five days, we will be able to completely confirm whether or not it is free from the lock."</p><p></p><p>"Excellent! In five days we will be able to start camouflaging and re-enter stealth."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, and then once the warp engines have cooled down, we can return to Blue Light!"</p><p></p><p>"We can't be careless, we've never been to the Star Eater starfield before, we don't know how many dangers are hidden here, we can't be careless."</p><p></p><p>"To ensure safety, I suggest sailing in the direction of detaching from the edge of the Star Eater starfield before completing the camouflage or the curvature engine cools down completely, in this way, the probability of bumping into a Star Eater will be very low."</p><p></p><p>"According to the information, as long as we don't land on a planet, we won't encounter star-eating bugs, the biggest danger in space comes from their eggs, as long as we are vigilant in not letting the eggs attach to the ship, we can ensure safety."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The officers of the Remote Star ship expressed their opinions, and their opinions were unanimously in favor of stability and safety, how meticulously.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to come to the Star Eater starfield and get rid of the lock of the Eight Hands, but don't be defeated by any inexplicable reason.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao stepped into the command center, the venue was violently quiet, and the crowd looked at Su Hao in unison, greatly surprised in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Didn't Hero Xu Shiqiang like to sleep in the dormitory to cultivate his 'supernatural ability'? How did he run out today. What a strange thing.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also said nonchalantly, "Just now, I found many suspected insect eggs flying past the airship."</p><p></p><p>Then he raised his hand and showed a white ellipsoidal bug egg in his hand and said, "This is what I just caught in by hand with a hundred shots, do you guys see if it's this thing?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of officers no longer wanted to spit out the fact of how Su Hao caught the bug egg from outside the spaceship with '100 shots', after seeing the bug egg in Su Hao's hand, one by one, as if their asses were burned by fire, they jumped up violently, pointing at the bug egg with a face full of horror, and breaking their voice, "This this this! ...... This is the insect egg of the Star Eating Insect! How could it be in your hand ......"</p><p></p><p>"It's too dangerous! Shipmate Xu Shiqiang, please make sure to destroy it as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"How did the Star Eating Insect eggs appear inside the ship? It's over, it's over, I'm afraid that the Star Eating Insects have all lurked inside the Remote Star! The entire ship must be exhumed as soon as possible ......"</p><p></p><p>"This starfield is really too dangerous, we must leave as soon as we're ready!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao coughed and waited for the crowd to quiet down before saying, "This is just bug eggs! Star-eating bugs are just that, all of you don't need to worry too much, I guarantee that they don't have the means to invade the Remote Star, and they won't be able to threaten us. After all, my 100 shots are very strong.</p><p></p><p>So, I suggest that we can go to a planet where there are mature body star-eating bugs active, and take the opportunity to capture some of them and bring them back to Blue Light for research. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>Jing!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 802</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Just as Suhao had expected, the next day Mother Dragon Shaduo returned with ample food, very proudly putting down five deer.</p><p></p><p>Under the pressure from the big eater Suhao, Mother Dragon Shaduo learned to use all four claws, hooking one deer with each claw, and then clamping another deer under her belly with the four claws.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the difficulty was very high.</p><p></p><p>In order for her child to eat his fill, she had no choice but to unlock such a high-difficulty hunting posture.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, she was in her prime, at the most vigorous stage of her strength, so there was no need to worry that carrying too much food would drain her stamina, making her unable to fly far.</p><p></p><p>After eating his fill, Suhao did not forget to praise his mother Shaduo: "Mother Shaduo, you brought back so much food this time, you're amazing!"</p><p></p><p>This praise almost sent Mother Dragon Shaduo to the heavens. For the first time, she experienced the joy of being a mother.</p><p></p><p>What was this? She had gained her child's approval and love, which was much happier than when she was in a relationship and mating.</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon turned to look at Dragon Brother Chipu and Dragon Sister Moli, also hoping these two children would praise her.</p><p></p><p>But then the two young dragons did nothing but burp after eating their fill...</p><p></p><p>The contrast was quite obvious.</p><p></p><p>She thought to herself: "These two foolish children, if only they were as smart as Leian!"</p><p></p><p>After Mother Dragon Shaduo routinely told the three young dragons some simple little stories, she entered the cave to take a nap. After she had slept enough, she would fly away with the food remains.</p><p></p><p>She decided that this time when she returned, she would bring back even more plump food.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that the mother dragon had flown away, Suhao returned to the hatching room and entered the pinball space to check on the progress of cultivating the gene modification liquid.</p><p></p><p>"Just a few more minutes and it will be ready! Let me assemble the filtration equipment first."</p><p></p><p>Suhao assembled the equipment quickly. After double checking that there were no errors in cultivating the gene modification liquid, he was about to extract it when he suddenly paused, as if he had thought of something: "It seems I haven't beaten those two young dragons today..."</p><p></p><p>To avoid the two young dragons coming in to make trouble in the middle of the experiment, Suhao decided to take the initiative and complete today's routine task first.</p><p></p><p>So Suhao got up and went out.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the howls of the two young dragons could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Owoooo~"</p><p>"Wuuuu~"</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons were beaten by Suhao until they were utterly confused, not understanding why their third brother had taken the initiative to come out and beat them today, and his strikes were even fiercer than usual.</p><p></p><p>After the beating, Suhao returned to the hatching room with satisfaction, calmly extracted the gene modification liquid, and filtered it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he obtained a full vial of clear liquid.</p><p></p><p>Before injecting it, Suhao closed his eyes and used his spiritual power to sense the surrounding environment. The area within a 2,000 meter radius was mapped into his mind. After a moment, he opened his eyes: "No abnormalities!"</p><p></p><p>Since a dragon's body was huge, gene modification would take a bit longer. He needed to be careful.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't think there would be much danger. Even if some random thing crawled into the nest, there were still two very strong young dragons there.</p><p></p><p>Suhao no longer hesitated and injected the entire gene modification liquid into his body. Soon he felt a wave of drowsiness and fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After confirming the mother dragon had left, the Fugold Squad immediately sprang into action. From above the Celestial Cliff, they rushed towards the crevice in the cliff. Excitement was written all over their faces, as if they had already captured the red golden young dragons and sold them for a good price.</p><p></p><p>Not long after they set off, they heard the familiar howls of young dragons echoing faintly among the mountains, making them even more excited, able to feel their hearts pounding in their chests.</p><p></p><p>What lively young dragons!</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo anxiously urged his team members to speed up, and he himself charged to the front.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, they arrived at the cliff crevice they had been eyeing.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo waved his hand and immediately said, "Proceed according to plan, split up and search for the giant dragon's nest. Blow the whistle immediately once you find it."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Captain Xibo!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone sprang into action, dispersing in different directions. After securing long ropes on the cliff, they slid down along the ropes, searching for the location of the giant dragon's nest.</p><p></p><p>Over an hour later, a clear whistle sounded from within the cliff crevice.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo punched the air excitedly: "Hahaha! Found it! It's Group Three's location. Gather manpower and go down to check it out immediately."</p><p></p><p>Shouldering various specialized dragon hunting tools, he secured a rope around himself and slid down the cliff crevice at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>Of the seven or eight people left guarding the cliff edge, except for the two sentries, the rest immediately followed suit, including the only soul mage Viya.</p><p></p><p>When capturing red golden young dragons, in order to avoid the young dragons struggling violently and getting injured to the point of being unsellable at a high price, a soul mage was needed to use soul arts to soothe them.</p><p></p><p>So Viya had to tag along.</p><p></p><p>They had done this many times before, but each time they felt extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The profession of 'dragon poachers' suited them perfectly, satisfying their desire for an adventurous and thrilling life while earning plenty of money.</p><p></p><p>It was just a bit dangerous. If they were discovered by the enraged mother dragon during their retreat, they would be dead for sure.</p><p></p><p>However, they chose their targets carefully, only targeting solitary mother dragons raising young dragons. They didn't have the guts to go after young dragons raised by two giant dragons together.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Big Beard Xibo and the others slid down the ropes to a spot with protruding rocks of all shapes and sizes. After sliding down a long stretch further, an enormous cave entrance suddenly appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>A stuffy, hot smell with a distinct bloody odor wafted into their nostrils.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo lowered his voice: "This is it. Wait for everyone to assemble, then prepare to enter the cave."</p><p></p><p>The few people behind him immediately crouched down on the rock face, not making a sound, waiting for the rest of the team to arrive.</p><p></p><p>According to Viya's assessment, there were at least five red golden young dragons in the nest. With just the few of them, it would not be a simple task to safely capture five young dragons.</p><p></p><p>However, Big Beard Xibo was not in a hurry. He had enough patience. After all, they had come this far, there was no reason to fail!</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because they sensed the movement outside that Dragon Brother Chipu and Dragon Sister Moli, driven by curiosity, ran out to see what was going on.</p><p></p><p>Then, halfway down this cliff with no sky or ground in sight, the eyes of the few people met the four eyes of the two young dragons.</p><p></p><p>When Big Beard Xibo saw the two young dragons, he was so excited that his beard almost flew up. He couldn't help but grin widely at the two young dragons.</p><p></p><p>As for the two young dragons, they had never seen such creatures that could climb walls before. Curious, they tilted their heads and studied these few humans.</p><p></p><p>To them, there was no innate fear of humans encoded in their genes.</p><p></p><p>What Chipu and Moli were thinking was: "Are these creatures edible?"</p><p></p><p>When encountering something good, one should share it. This was Dragon Brother Chipu's virtuous character. He happily retracted his head and rushed into the hatching room, wanting to share this special discovery with his third brother.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Dragon Sister Moli also retracted her head and ran inside.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the rest of the Fugold Squad swung over from other directions.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had assembled.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo said in a low voice: "Go, follow me into the cave. Be careful! Viya, stay right behind me, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Viya's expression also turned serious as she nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that everyone was ready, Big Beard Xibo took off the chain slung over his shoulder, took a deep breath, pushed off with his feet, and as his body moved far away from the rock face, he rapidly slid down, swinging back into the dragon's cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish~"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a large amount of shattered rocks falling from the cliff face, members of the Fugold Squad one by one leapt into the nest's cave entrance and steadily landed on the platform at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>After taking up positions here in preparation for any ambush, they realized that the inside of the cave was completely silent.</p><p></p><p>Where were the red golden young dragons?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the hatching room, Dragon Brother Chipu and Dragon Sister Moli were circling around Suhao with curious looks.</p><p></p><p>Because at this point, Suhao had been encased in a layer of transparent crystal, and the inside of the crystal could not be seen clearly. Only the vague shape of a young dragon could be discerned.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons had big question marks in their minds: "Why did our third brother turn into a shiny crystal?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the two young dragons had already forgotten their intention to share their new discovery with their third brother. They stretched out their claws, curiously scratching at the crystal.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Big Beard Xibo and his men charged in.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons immediately turned their heads.</p><p></p><p>Human eyes met dragon eyes.</p><p></p><p>The air seemed to freeze instantly.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons sensed an intense threat from the humans and instinctively bared their teeth, growling menacingly.</p><p></p><p>"Grrr owoooo --"</p><p></p><p>Then Dragon Brother Chipu just opened his mouth and charged recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo said in a low voice: "Viya!"</p><p></p><p>Viya understood and immediately released the soul art she had prepared.</p><p></p><p>'Sleep Spell!'</p><p></p><p>Two yellowish mists like giant pythons slithered out from her hands, intertwining and expanding, enveloping the two young dragons.</p><p></p><p>The fiercely charging Dragon Brother Chipu suddenly felt an overwhelming wave of sleepiness. His whole body seemed to lose strength, and he stumbled forward two steps before collapsing to the ground, eyelids dropping as he fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>As for Dragon Sister Moli, she had also collapsed and fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo waved his hand: "Tie them up!"</p><p></p><p>People immediately rushed forward, quickly and securely binding the two young dragons with some strange restraining method.</p><p></p><p>However, Big Beard Xibo did not rejoice at capturing the two young dragons. Instead, he frowned: "Why are there only two? Search thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>He glanced around the hatching room, his gaze pausing briefly on the crystal formed by Suhao, before turning away to quickly search other areas of the nest.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he returned to the hatching room, asking Viya in disbelief: "You said there would be at least five red golden young dragons, right? Didn't you say it was almost certain? How are there only two now?"</p><p></p><p>Viya said awkwardly, "Should we look around some more?"</p><p></p><p>"Kachak kachak~"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a strange crystal clinking sound came from a corner of the hatching room.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards the sound to see the previously motionless giant transparent crystal starting to shrink and recede, revealing a hint of red gold.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the massive transparent crystal transformed into a red golden young dragon.</p><p></p><p>The red golden young dragon opened its eyes and casually glanced around.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo exclaimed in astonishment: "What kind of dragon is this?"</p><p></p><p>That's about 9,000 characters for today, I've worked hard to increase the length!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 645</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Early or late, it just so happened that the three of them were 80 billion kilometers away in outer space when it occurred. One could only say the 'Calamity System' was foolish enough.</p><p></p><p>Erupting at this moment, what was it trying to do? Even if it vaporized the entire source planet, so what?</p><p></p><p>By now, Su Hao had confirmed that the 'Calamity System' did not possess any profound intelligence, only operating according to specific rules.</p><p></p><p>In other words, there was no so-called 'enemy' above Su Hao's head. As long as he successfully found the energy trajectory of the 'Calamity System', there was a great possibility of completely mastering it, making it a part of Su Hao's vast knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the problem Su Hao faced was whether to return to the source planet now.</p><p></p><p>It was just that this place was too far from the source planet, and 'positioning teleportation' would not succeed until eight hours later.</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of positioning stones he had placed all over the source planet were being destroyed at an extremely fast pace. If he did not teleport back in time, they would all become ineffective soon.</p><p></p><p>"No! I placed two positioning stones on the satellite of the 'Disaster Seal System'. As of now, the positioning stones on the satellite have not been affected. Perhaps I can wait a bit longer and see how things go."</p><p></p><p>The current situation on the source planet was unclear. Although he was confident that nothing could instantly kill him, he still could not be too reckless.</p><p></p><p>He turned to ask Ya Shan and Feng Chengdao, "What is the current condition of the positioning stones you placed on the satellite?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "I only placed one positioning stone on the satellite, and it is currently undamaged."</p><p></p><p>Feng Chengdao said, "I placed eighty stones, and they are all fine!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao felt reassured.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng then said, "Why don't I teleport back to the satellite first to check the situation?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment and nodded, "Be careful."</p><p></p><p>Since Feng Cheng wanted to go and check the situation, let him go. Even in the worst case, he could revive him soon.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled confidently. As a Celestial Being cultivator, what problem could there be? "Don't worry, Old Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, under Fei Xianmu's envious gaze, he transformed into [Mingtzu], donned various protective spells, and then disappeared from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Feng Cheng transmitted back visuals and shouted in the group, "Holy crap! Old Master Wei, Old Master Ya, come look quickly! The entire source planet is on fire, even more exaggerated than the end of the world... The source planet is doomed!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Ya Shan were stunned, then they transmitted themselves to Feng Cheng's coordinates.</p><p></p><p>Only Fei Xianmu was left alone in the spaceship, dazed, "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao teleported to the satellite of the source planet, and a dazzling red and yellow light shone from the side, involuntarily drawing his gaze.</p><p></p><p>That was the location of the source planet.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the source planet no longer had its original beautiful pattern of blue, yellow, and white.</p><p></p><p>It was a sheet of red and yellow flames.</p><p></p><p>Like a large fireball doused in oil and then ignited.</p><p></p><p>In the raging flames, violent energy could be seen surging and rising, as if the planet's surface was covered with densely packed high-explosive bombs that were being detonated one after another, raising wave after wave of deadly tides.</p><p></p><p>This scene looked even more terrifying than when the Key Star was invaded by the virus.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the other two stared in astonishment at this apocalyptic scene of the source planet, speechless for a long time.</p><p></p><p>They had gone to the Red Ice Star for a spacecraft test flight, and it had only been a month until now...</p><p></p><p>In just one month of absence, how did the perfectly fine source planet turn into this state?</p><p></p><p>If this was the work of the 'Calamity System' targeting the three of them, it seemed too exaggerated, clearly aimed at Su Hao alone. Why go to such extremes?</p><p></p><p>He, Su Hao, was just a small person. What merit or ability did he have...</p><p></p><p>This reminded him of a question he had asked Ya Shan a long time ago: If there were cockroaches in the house, how should they be cleared out?</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan had answered: Burn down the house!</p><p></p><p>Seen this way, Su Hao was just an undying cockroach living on someone else's planet, and the owner got so angry that he burned down the planet.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng pointed at the increasingly violent source planet and asked, "Are there still people alive up there?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "Hard to say, perhaps those mages in New Era City could still hold on for a moment."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Hao immediately said, "Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Although the explosions and flames on the planet were fierce, to be honest, they were not enough for the three extremely powerful Celestial Being cultivators + [Mingtzu] to even blink at, able to go in and out unscathed.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the other lifeforms on the source planet did not have this ability.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took the lead and flew towards what seemed to be the not-too-distant source planet, with Ya Shan and Feng Cheng following closely behind.</p><p></p><p>Currently, all the positioning stones Su Hao had placed on the planet had been destroyed, including those hidden in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>This made Su Hao very curious about what kind of force could pervade every corner of the planet.</p><p></p><p>After entering the atmosphere, a raging heat and impact force battered their crystal armor, blocked by the protective formations outside the armor.</p><p></p><p>All they could see was a dazzling brightness, surrounded by raging energy running amok, even their divine senses were greatly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao carefully searched with his suppressed divine sense but did not detect any signs of life, not even underground creatures seemed to have survived.</p><p></p><p>After confirming their current location on the source planet, Su Hao immediately activated continuous flashes, rushing towards New Era City at top speed.</p><p></p><p>Hopefully, there were still mages alive who could tell him what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao entered the center of New Era City and carefully searched.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there were no signs of life, not even a single corpse left behind, all turned to ashes in this catastrophic energy.</p><p></p><p>The once prosperous super city now did not even have the appearance of 'ruins' left.</p><p></p><p>The land looked as if it had been plowed, a complete mess, and then melted into a red molten lava under the high temperatures, flowing rampantly.</p><p></p><p>"In this short period of time, what exactly happened on the source planet?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao closed his eyes and carefully sensed, but all he could sense was chaotic energy fluctuations, nothing else.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng also arrived at this place, hardly believing this was the original New Era City.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Music Palace did not even leave any remains behind.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng posted a shocked emoji in the group: "Everything is gone!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Let's go check the ocean!"</p><p></p><p>In this situation, some marine life might have survived.</p><p></p><p>When the three of them reached the ocean, they found that the area above the sea was also covered in raging energy, with the seawater surging violently, as if countless deep-sea bombs had been thrown into it.</p><p></p><p>A large number of fish died and floated on the surface, quickly boiled.</p><p></p><p>However, many creatures also managed to survive by a fluke.</p><p></p><p>But this catastrophe was still ongoing with no sign of abating. The current turmoil on the source planet was only escalating, triggering violent movements in the planet's core.</p><p></p><p>In the subsequent chain reaction, these lucky surviving creatures would likely not last much longer before perishing as well.</p><p></p><p>It could be called a mass extinction event.</p><p></p><p>After watching for a while, Su Hao sighed, "It seems there is no useful information. Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration hit Feng Cheng, and he said uncertainly, "Oh right, Old Master Wei, I arranged for observers to take shifts on duty at the 'Seal Satellite'. Perhaps the observers on the satellite are still alive. And the satellite has telescopes and monitors, so there might be records of this incident."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's eyes lit up, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>At this point, there was no way to reverse what had happened. The most important thing was to figure out exactly what had occurred.</p><p></p><p>The three of them successively teleported back to the satellite and began searching on the various satellites.</p><p></p><p>Just as Feng Cheng had said, there were indeed people on duty at the observation stations on the satellites at all times.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng soon found two recorders at an observation post.</p><p></p><p>A man and a woman, wearing light spacesuits, staring at the screen and calculating something. When a towering crystal armor suddenly appeared behind them, they were startled.</p><p></p><p>This scene was as terrifying as it could be.</p><p></p><p>It was as if... the satellite was haunted?</p><p></p><p>Before the two could scream or resist, Feng Cheng immediately identified himself, "It's me, Feng Cheng!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he exited the [Mingtzu] state, revealing his face.</p><p></p><p>...</p>

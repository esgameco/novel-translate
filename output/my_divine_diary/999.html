        <h1>Chapter 999</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The intelligent lifeforms created by them were also intelligent beings, and fell within the scope of Suhao and the other two's 'reverence for life'.</p><p></p><p>Regarding these created intelligent lifeforms, Suhao and the others had also discussed the issue of 'humanity', and finally reached a unified understanding about these lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>The essence of these lifeforms they created was to serve Suhao and the other two's experiments.</p><p></p><p>So the prerequisite for revering these lifeforms was that they completed the experimental goals.</p><p></p><p>Before that, using these created beings as experimental subjects, the three of them felt no psychological pressure. After completing the corresponding experiments, individuals who remained mentally normal would gain a certain degree of freedom until their natural end of life.</p><p></p><p>This situation was similar to the various races on the Infinite Land.</p><p></p><p>The living beings of these races were essentially experimental subjects created by the three of them, except that long ago, these intelligent races had already completed their experimental goals, and thereafter gained relative freedom, while Suhao and the others no longer interfered with the details of their existence.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The three wandered and chatted idly on the Infinite Land.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, they encountered all kinds of situations - a woman who killed her lover out of love and hatred, a cultivator who killed and robbed fleeing thousands of miles, small-scale racial wars and conflicts, a cultivator bullying others with force to snatch a beauty but was killed by a hero, a young man returning after learning martial arts to humiliate his childhood bully, a mortal crossing the sea to seek a mountain and become an apprentice in pursuit of immortality...</p><p></p><p>However, these scenes that entered the three's eyes were as plain as a bowl of clear water.</p><p></p><p>That touching love and hatred, those beautiful poetic lines that stirred the soul - at some point, they could no longer arouse any sweet feelings in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the three realized that on this Infinite Land they created themselves, they were but a wisp of drifting smoke, walking on the road, seemingly there yet not.</p><p></p><p>As if everything in the world no longer had any relation to them.</p><p></p><p>Inexplicably, Suhao suddenly laughed: "Yashan, Fengcheng, we created the Infinite Land with the intention of establishing a 'cosmic center' for ourselves, a place we could call home.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Infinite Land is built, I cannot find that feeling of 'home' here, but rather feel like an outsider."</p><p></p><p>Yashan pondered: "Perhaps it is because we lack true family on this land?"</p><p></p><p>To Fengcheng, wherever Suhao and Yashan were, that was home. He had no deep feelings about it, so he asked in surprise: "Old Yashan, you're not thinking of taking a wife and having children, are you!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan shook his head: "Even if I take a wife and have children now, the wife I marry and children I have will not give me a sense of home. It would be meaningless."</p><p></p><p>Yashan's true home was only the one in his memory, which was basically shattered after his first wife was killed by the Bone Demon in battle.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Don't always think of wife and kids when you hear the word 'home'."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng laughed: "It's a habit. Whenever I hear Old Yashan mention family, I can't help but wonder what Old Yashan's wife and children look like."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "No use wondering, it's been too long. You'll never have a chance to see them.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, I realize that before the Infinite Land was built, I thought that after it was completed, I could settle down here and do research peacefully, and I looked forward to that for a while.</p><p></p><p>But after the Infinite Land was truly built, I didn't get that so-called sense of belonging. Like Old Master said, I feel like an outsider on this land, unable to integrate into it.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it's because I'm used to following Old Master to explore the universe everywhere, so when I truly stop, I feel a bit unaccustomed.</p><p></p><p>I still prefer to follow Old Master and go on adventures everywhere."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng nodded in agreement: "Indeed, when we were weak, we longed to become powerful beyond measure. But after becoming powerful, we miss the sense of adventure from when we were weak. Haha, I always feel too greedy, wanting everything."</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed: "It has nothing to do with being powerful or not. You two are just lacking a sense of crisis. I suggest you operate your avatars to go die a few times in the major disasters of the universe - that nostalgic illness of yours will probably be cured.</p><p></p><p>Of course, I'm joking, but you can try it if you want."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was eager to try: "We could give it a shot."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "There's a saying 'the four seas are home' - we're in that state now, so you could say 'the starry seas are home'. Think about it, there's nothing wrong with that. Since we can't find a sense of home on the Infinite Land, we might as well go with the flow."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Suhao continued: "Once I finish this project I'm working on, I'll take you two away from the Infinite Land to continue exploring the unknown depths of the universe!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were stunned with pleasant surprise as they looked at their Old Master.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "But I can't say for sure how long it will take to complete this project."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After wandering with Yashan and Fengcheng for a while, Suhao found that his thinking had indeed gained some new perspectives.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the lab, filled with renewed vigor: "Building a physical form for the Bouncing Space is the ultimate goal, but in my exploration process, I'm bound to make new discoveries - that's the joy of exploration.</p><p></p><p>I should enjoy this process, without needing to be tense about achieving that goal."</p><p></p><p>So the question is, what kind of thing can adhere to the outer surface of the Bouncing Space and be carried away by it?</p><p></p><p>I don't know.</p><p></p><p>Let's just try one by one!</p><p></p><p>There will definitely be an answer.</p><p></p><p>And in the process of trying, there are bound to be other surprises.</p><p></p><p>Another hundred years passed, and Suhao still hadn't succeeded in getting any material to adhere to the Bouncing Space and follow it roaming the universe.</p><p></p><p>That day, he was going through the data from his previous failed experiments, trying to find loopholes in the experiments, and soon fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"So many attempts and failures have actually helped me filter out the vast majority of common materials. The common materials on these planets won't be carried away by the Bouncing Space, so I don't need to do any more attempts in that area.</p><p></p><p>Whatever can be carried away by the Bouncing Space must have enough special qualities. But what could it be?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Suhao shook his head: "Perhaps my way of thinking is flawed. Exhaustive enumeration is indeed a viable approach, but not a very good one. I think there must be a clue to this problem. If I can grasp that clue, I'll be able to find the right answer."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, and recalling his past experiences, Suhao couldn't help but smile: "It's possible that the thing that can adhere to the outer surface of the Bouncing Space, like the answers to the problems I've explored before, is right beside me."</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he had explored many problems, and the answers to most of them turned out to be simpler than he expected.</p><p></p><p>This matched the saying - the great way is simple.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how simple the answer, for a person to go from not knowing to knowing, it could be considered simple yet also difficult.</p><p></p><p>For something simple, perhaps just a word or phrase as a hint could lead to understanding.</p><p></p><p>For something difficult, if you don't get it, you just don't get it. If you can't figure it out, you can't figure it out. This has no necessary connection to how intelligent one is or how high their IQ is.</p><p></p><p>Suhao put the question back into the Bouncing Space, pondering to himself: "This clue may lie within the Bouncing Space itself. I should start from the essence of the Bouncing Space to think about this problem.</p><p></p><p>The Bouncing Space receives information from the outside and emits information from the inside...</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Bouncing Space's only connection with the outside world is 'information'.</p><p></p><p>The kind of material I'm looking for that can adhere to the outer surface of the Bouncing Space may need to have some information-like qualities, allowing it to achieve a certain degree of fusion with the Bouncing Space, so that it can possibly follow the Bouncing Space away."</p><p></p><p>"Materials containing information could be waves, electrons, special particles, light, radiation... Theoretically speaking, the Bouncing Space receives information from the outside world in these forms and stores it in a different way inside..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his pace slowed down until he couldn't help but swear: "F**k?"</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have realized what could follow the Bouncing Space away.</p>

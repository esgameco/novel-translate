        <h1>Chapter 855</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao wanted to directly observe the birth process of Baikal from nothing to existence, but it was not easy. The red giant star was too large. Even if he combined his small self with Ayashan and Fengcheng's, making their numbers greater, it would still take a very long time to fully explore the entire detectable range of the red giant star.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until after wandering for a year that they finally roughly delineated the general active range of Baikal.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Suhao decided to control his [God] avatar to personally come to this red giant star and take a look.</p><p></p><p>"I dare not think about normal stars, but for a red giant star, perhaps with the power I currently possess, I have a chance to approach or even land on it. Let me try!"</p><p></p><p>Then he used the 'galaxy network' to transmit his [God] avatar to the nearest planet to the red giant star, activated his starlight travel and flew towards the red giant star.</p><p></p><p>After approaching the red giant star, he exited the faster-than-light travel state, stacked all protective measures, and confidently flew towards the red giant star.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Suhao's [God] avatar perished.</p><p></p><p>And he failed to land on this massive body as he wished.</p><p></p><p>The might of a star was still far beyond the limit his body could withstand, even if it was just an aging star.</p><p></p><p>Waking up from the second-level world, Suhao muttered: "I didn't expect that those ten-colored plates that looked like they couldn't withstand my punch could actually survive in such a violent environment, it's simply inconceivable."</p><p></p><p>Of course, they only looked fragile. Suhao had not tried to actually violently punch them, as each one was a cherished experimental body that he couldn't bear to damage.</p><p></p><p>However, even if he did violently punch them, perhaps Baikal would not be harmed.</p><p></p><p>After all, the material that made up Baikal's body was a conceptual substance similar to light, different from the stones and tables we normally see. The impact force that could shatter mountains and rivers might not cause destructive damage to them when striking Baikal's body.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps only 'information' could destroy Baikal. Just like the 'soul-disturbing technique' mastered by the deities, which directly dissolves the deities' will, decaying Baikal's soul structure from the information level."</p><p></p><p>After getting up and moving around, he lay down again, entered the billiard space, controlled another [God] avatar, adapted for a while, and then transmitted himself to the small world where the deities were imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>He greeted the enthusiastic and surprised deities: "Well, well, you all seem to be in good spirits, it seems you had a very pleasant vacation!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the deities saw Suhao appear, they immediately surrounded him from all directions, describing to Suhao how far they had progressed in their 'games' like offering treasures, and criticizing how poorly the other deities played their games, to the point of almost fighting each other.</p><p></p><p>They were just like a group of internet-addicted teenagers, of course, teenagers of unknown age.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's goal was to use the abilities of these deities to transform the Crucis system, so the games he loaded for the deities were somewhat similar to construction games like 'Minecraft', but far more demanding than 'Minecraft'. The eighteen deities needed to complete the construction of specific 'inner worlds', which would ultimately be interconnected by the eighteen deities to form a vast inner world capable of enveloping an entire planet.</p><p></p><p>However, this level of difficulty was just right for the deities. Over the past two years, the deities had become quite engrossed in the games, vying with each other and all wanting to outdo the others.</p><p></p><p>Suhao took some time to check the deities' learning progress and the progress of building the rule framework. Finding it faster than expected, he said with satisfaction: "Not bad, not bad, it seems you all have some gaming talent! Since that's the case, after you complete this game, I'll load another game with even greater challenges for you.</p><p></p><p>But your vacation is temporarily over. Next, I have an important task to assign you."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing about an 'important task', the deities immediately became solemn and looked at each other. The golden deity Bali cautiously asked: "Lord Leian, what is this task? I'm afraid I can't do a good job if it's too important, and may cause you trouble. Perhaps the other deities are more capable and reliable."</p><p></p><p>When the other deities heard Bali's words, they immediately refuted him: "Lord Bali, you mustn't belittle yourself. Among the eighteen of us, you are the most reliable and efficient in doing things."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that they were about to start arguing, Suhao stopped them with a smile: "Don't worry, each of you will have a part. It's related to you, so it won't be difficult for you."</p><p></p><p>The deities quieted down and asked curiously, "What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "Go back to your hometown."</p><p></p><p>The deities: "???"</p><p></p><p>They wanted to say that the Crucis system was their hometown, but didn't dare voice it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they were transmitted by Suhao to a planet outside the red giant star, and then went out into space.</p><p></p><p>Suhao pointed at the distant, huge red fireball: "Look, that is your hometown."</p><p></p><p>The moment they saw the red giant star, all the deities immediately sensed the Baikal consciousness they had suppressed in the core of the ten-colored plates stirring, making them tremble in fear. After a while, they gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely this stirring of Baikal within them that confirmed to them that the 'hometown' Suhao spoke of was real.</p><p></p><p>This left them utterly shocked. They all looked at Suhao, not understanding how he had found Baikal's homeland.</p><p></p><p>They knew how vast the galaxy was from their explorations into space. And the number of planets in the universe was innumerable. How could he have precisely found a planet that was Baikal's mother star?</p><p></p><p>Could it be...that Leian Oakes possessed the ability to sense the entire universe and galaxies? Plus the ability to treat an entire galaxy as his own backyard, coming and going as he pleased...</p><p></p><p>They dared not imagine it. In their perception, light was the fastest, yet for light to roam the universe would take years to calculate.</p><p></p><p>Starting from a thousand years, with no upper limit.</p><p></p><p>And Leian Oakes...could move instantaneously!</p><p></p><p>"Not choosing to go against Leian Oakes was an extremely wise choice."</p><p></p><p>The thunder deity Gu stared at the huge object in the distance, uncertain: "Lord Leian, are you sure this is Baikal's homeland? But this is a star, I'm worried I'll turn to ashes before even getting close. And what exactly is this important task you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "This red giant star is indeed Baikal's homeland, because I can sense numerous traces of Baikal from this red giant star. As long as you enter this star, you'll be able to see a lot of Baikal.</p><p></p><p>As for the task I want you to do, it's very simple - explore and record the environment of this red giant star according to my requirements. The world-building assistant will provide you with specific guidance on how to do it. I just updated the assistant for you, adding an 'exploration' function. After entering the red giant star, turn it on."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the deities couldn't help but shudder, appearing a bit panicked, because in their view, asking them to explore a star was almost the same as asking them to go to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Suhao didn't care how the deities felt, and flew towards the red giant star first: "Let's go, use your 'teleportation' to fly over."</p><p></p><p>Then he constructed a 'starlight travel' outer shell, activated starlight travel and flew towards the red giant star, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The deities looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>The order deity Redlight hesitated: "Should we go over? I have a feeling we'll be burned to ashes."</p><p></p><p>Ever since they had occupied Baikal, they had regarded Baikal's main body as their own creation and cherished it dearly. They had never tested how much impact this ten-colored plate could withstand.</p><p></p><p>It was just like how few people would test from what height they would die if they fell.</p><p></p><p>So over the years, their understanding of Baikal's main body's strength was very limited.</p><p></p><p>Even when they were initially competing to devour and fuse with Baikal's main body, it was just absorption and fusion. They had never tried roasting it in flames to test its heat resistance.</p><p></p><p>When the other deities heard Redlight's words that seemed to sway them into being captured, they couldn't help but mock him: "Well, well, it's rare to see Lord Redlight afraid of something. Don't tell me Lord Redlight is actually scared!"</p><p></p><p>Redlight had long gotten used to the other deities' scornful taunts over the past few years, so he simply ignored such rubbish talk.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the deity of darkness Eternal remained silent and directly entered the 'teleportation' state, transforming into streams of light shooting towards the red giant star.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Bali didn't hesitate either and followed him over.</p><p></p><p>The other deities realized they had no choice but to go, since this was a personal instruction from Leian.</p><p></p><p>So one by one, they reluctantly transformed into streams of light and shot towards the red giant star.</p>

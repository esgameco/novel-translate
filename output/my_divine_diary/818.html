        <h1>Chapter 818</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>On an island called Skull Dragon Peak in the latter half of the Heaven's Channel, the leaders of the three major powerful pirate groups gathered at a round table.</p><p></p><p>Two human pirate groups and one mountain troll pirate group were discussing joining forces to take down the 'Evil Dragon Legend'.</p><p></p><p>"Those greedy and stupid fools in the first half of the channel actually got killed by a mere adult red gold dragon, hahaha, it's simply the funniest joke I've heard this year."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, those selfish and greedy idiots, facing a red gold dragon, actually thought they could take it on alone and face the dragon by themselves? They deserved to die."</p><p></p><p>"An adult red gold dragon is level 7 like us, but after all it's a dragon, its strength is far greater than an ordinary level 7. It's delusional to think a single pirate group has the power to capture a dragon. If they had a fraction of our wisdom, it wouldn't have turned out like this. So you see, greed is the cause of death for pirates, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, as such magnanimous people, we are destined to be the ultimate winners. But before that, we should determine how to distribute the dragon after capturing it, to avoid damaging our friendship later."</p><p></p><p>"We'll directly kill the dragon, sell the dragon meat and body as ingredients, and split the money evenly. As for the three young dragons, we'll take one each, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>"An excellent proposal! But the three young dragons differ in size, how shall we decide who picks first?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, the three magnanimous people couldn't help but fall silent, looking at each other, then saying in unison: "Of course I'll pick first!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately everyone started arguing their own reasons, getting more and more chaotic. Finally they all slammed the table and were about to disperse unhappily. Seeing this, a smiling little bearded man stepped forward and mediated: "Let's talk this through calmly. How about following pirate rules - whoever has the biggest fist picks first, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The three slammed the table in loud approval, rolling up their sleeves ready to fight.</p><p></p><p>But the little bearded man quickly stood in the middle and said: "Wait, wait, I'm not done yet. Since you three are evenly matched, there's no need for violence and damage our friendship. How about each of you sends a subordinate to fight it out and decide the order that way?"</p><p></p><p>The three frowned but could only agree.</p><p></p><p>The little bearded man breathed a long sigh of relief: "The 'Evil Dragon Legend' is expected to arrive tomorrow or the day after, so we'd better settle the rules quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Such allied gatherings were happening in more than one place.</p><p></p><p>Every allied team believed they were the chosen ones, that capturing the red gold young dragons would be as easy as taking candy from a baby.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Golden God Bali arrived at another part of the continent under human influence.</p><p></p><p>However, Bali had just flown into the continent when a grey eagle flew over from afar to fly alongside him.</p><p></p><p>Bali slowed down, hovering in the air to admire: "As expected of the Night God, you discovered me as soon as I entered this continent. Truly powerful beyond imagination."</p><p></p><p>The grey eagle flapped its wings to hover in front of Bali, speaking in human words: "Bali, why didn't you just stay in your Heaven's Prairie panning for gold, what brings you to my territory?"</p><p></p><p>Bali smiled: "Well, I am nominally your deputy god after all, can't I just come chat with you for no reason?"</p><p></p><p>The grey eagle just stared at Bali without answering.</p><p></p><p>Bali spread his hands: "Alright, after all these years you're still such a dull god. With your gloomy demeanor, what's the fun in living? I do actually have something to find you about this time, and you'll definitely be very interested. It might even bring some fun to your life. Hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>The grey eagle said: "Just say it, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>Bali raised his brows: "Say it right here? That won't do, you'll have to at least offer me a cup of tea first before I tell you."</p><p></p><p>The grey eagle was silent for a moment, then said: "Just come over!"</p><p></p><p>After the grey eagle finished speaking, two seconds of silence passed, then it suddenly transformed back to its original bird consciousness, flapping its wings in fright as a person appeared in front of it, flying away hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Bali muttered: "Such divine skill in 'shared vision avatar', I'm so envious."</p><p></p><p>Only the Night God Yongshe could manifest avatars anywhere within his domain at will.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Bali arrived at a deep mountain shrouded in mist like a thin veil, where a simple courtyard palace could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>This was the Night God Yongshe's guest residence.</p><p></p><p>As for their true bodies' locations, the eighteen gods all tacitly hid them deeply, unknown to each other.</p><p></p><p>To them, as long as their true body wasn't destroyed, they were immortal.</p><p></p><p>All the apparent palaces were just for receiving guests outwardly.</p><p></p><p>Bali entered the mountain palace unobstructed. In the main hall, a beautiful black-haired woman sat at the tea table, having waited for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Bali walked in shamelessly and sat across from the woman, drinking the warm tea in one gulp and laughing: "Yongshe, this is such a nice place you have here!"</p><p></p><p>This black-haired beauty was indeed the Night God Yongshe.</p><p></p><p>The Night God Yongshe had a very serene face, her calm eyes looking at Bali as she said: "My place can't compare to your Golden Palace. What's the matter, you can tell me now."</p><p></p><p>Bali dropped his smile, serious: "I encountered a powerful opponent, got taken down by him twice."</p><p></p><p>Yongshe nodded: "That's normal."</p><p></p><p>Bali suddenly didn't feel like talking anymore.</p><p></p><p>What did she mean by 'that's normal'?</p><p></p><p>He said helplessly: "After all these years, Yongshe, your words are still so hurtful. What I wanted to tell you is, I suspect the one who defeated me is the 19th god."</p><p></p><p>Yongshe's hand holding the tea froze, looking up at Bali.</p><p></p><p>Bali said: "You heard me right, I mean the 19th god, I suspect a new god has been born recently without anyone noticing - the 'Secret God'. Most crucially, he may well be a red gold dragon."</p><p></p><p>Yongshe said calmly: "Bali, you have to take responsibility for your words. You should know, there is nothing in this world that can escape my eyes. If a new god was born, I would definitely know. It's impossible for a new god to appear without a sound."</p><p></p><p>Bali immediately waved his hands: "I'm just guessing, you know what I mean by guessing? I'm not taking any responsibility."</p><p></p><p>Yongshe turned her eyes away, feeling at this moment that she couldn't bear to look straight at this deputy god.</p><p></p><p>Bali laughed, then waved his hand casually: "As for why I'm guessing this, you'll understand after seeing this scene. I experienced it personally, it's not made up."</p><p></p><p>Then shamelessly, he projected the experiences of the divine envoy Bode and himself in illusion form to play out.</p><p></p><p>After watching, the Night God Yongshe frowned: "So you haven't actually seen this opponent in person? Bali, it's been so many years, how have you become so fragile?"</p><p></p><p>Bali took two deep breaths to calm his agitation before forcing a smile: "You're right Yongshe, I have become a bit fragile. But don't you find this guy interesting?</p><p></p><p>He must be a newly ascended god, and a prime god level at that. He's been following that red gold dragon, protecting the dragon and its three young. Perhaps the new god is the red gold dragon's mate.</p><p></p><p>We can guess that while nurturing the young in the Cloud Valley Mountains, he happened to capture a stray 'divine light' by chance and ascended to godhood..."</p><p></p><p>The Night God Yongshe remained silent, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bali saw that she was tempted, so he struck while the iron was hot: "Let me put it this way, I'm the first to discover this new god, and you're the second. Most crucially, he definitely doesn't know about the 'no new gods born' pact between us gods. This new god following the red gold dragon must be the 'divine light' itself.</p><p></p><p>Aren't you curious what his divine light is, Yongshe? If you defeat him, the 'divine light' will be yours. As for me..."</p><p></p><p>He gestured with his hand: "Just give me this tiny bit and I'll be satisfied. You know, as you can see, I'm so fragile and not interested in power. You don't need to worry about my greed. I'm your best partner, and the reason I can be your deputy god, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Night God Yongshe raised her eyes to look into Bali's, calmly asking: "The 'Secret God' red gold dragon, you say? Then I'll go take a look with you. Where is this Secret God, Bali?"</p>

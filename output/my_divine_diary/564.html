        <h1>Chapter 564</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng lost his parents at a very young age. It was said they unfortunately sacrificed themselves during the Catastrophe of Primal Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Having lost his parents as a child, he was always very insecure, but firmly believed in justice and righteousness in the world. Once he saw a child fall from a height, bleeding from the mouth. Without hesitation, he rushed over, carried the child on his back and hurried to the town clinic, successfully saving the child's life.</p><p></p><p>However, when the child's parents arrived, they slapped Zhi Peng's face hard without a word, accusing him of pushing their child from the height and demanding he pay with his life.</p><p></p><p>A child without parents is treated so shabbily, even though his parents died protecting others.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't remember how he got through that long period of time. But he knows, even if he understood the result of saving someone would be misunderstanding, he would still rush to save them without hesitation!</p><p></p><p>However, over time, he became a timid and reclusive person. Though his heart yearned for friends to play with, he was afraid of being looked down upon and rejected.</p><p></p><p>One day, he suddenly awakened as a Primal Mage, moreover an extremely rare Illusion-type Primal Mage of Fantasy. After evaluation by the association, he was named 'Let's Be Friends'.</p><p></p><p>He had almost no offensive power, weaker in combat than even a novice Primal Mage. But he found that everyone looked at him with great fear after learning of his ability.</p><p></p><p>After the town chief reported his ability, he was transferred to the higher city and imprisoned for eight full years. Only after everyone in the prison became his friend did he escape, finally gaining his long-desired freedom.</p><p></p><p>During his sunless imprisonment, a sliver of darkness grew in his bright heart. This sliver urged him every day during his time on the run to kill all those who had bullied him, though it was suppressed by his sense of justice.</p><p></p><p>Later in Chaungnan City, he met a kind woman and decided to marry her to live an ordinary life.</p><p></p><p>The peace did not last long. His wife was abducted, and while he foolishly waited at home searching and asking for help to no avail, two days later his wife returned and told him what happened before committing suicide.</p><p></p><p>Heartbroken, he suddenly hated immensely the world his parents had given their lives to protect.</p><p></p><p>Then he spent half a year wandering, making many powerful trusted friends who, after hearing his story, all vowed to avenge him.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he took his revenge, massacring the entire Chao royal family.</p><p></p><p>But the hatred in his heart did not diminish at all. Instead, with the death of the Chao royals, his hatred transferred to all royalty.</p><p></p><p>Now in an abandoned pavilion in the wilderness, after much thought, he made an insane decision.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng said, "Friends, we have killed the unforgivable evil Chao royals, and I have my revenge. But there are still countless scum like them in this world. It's unimaginable how many suffer at their hands every day. My own liberation does not count as true liberation. I want to save those who are oppressed. So...I want to kill all the royals in every city, let the sunshine shine on every land. Will you help me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhi Peng's words, his friends were stunned by this insane idea.</p><p></p><p>Kill all the royals? It was impossible! The power the royals had amassed over the years was unimaginable, second only to the Primal Mage Association itself.</p><p></p><p>Just the various Primal artifacts collected by a single royal family would be too much for them to handle, not to mention the many powerful Primal Mages the royals recruited and supported.</p><p></p><p>Massacring the royals of a small city was easy, but opposing the entire world seemed impossible to them.</p><p></p><p>The ponytailed girl, not wanting Zhi Peng to be upset, quickly said, "Brother Zhi, we'll definitely help you, but killing all the royals is simply not feasible for just us. Plus, the Mage Association won't let us run wild either."</p><p></p><p>The others chimed in, "That's right! We're strong, but limited. Primal Mages have strict elemental weaknesses. One mistake and we could lose our lives."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng insisted, "But if we don't do this, no one else will. Then the same misfortunes I suffered will keep happening every day. Extending from myself to others, I don't want more people to endure my pain. I want to end it all. And believe me, I can do it. In the future, there will be more who wish to join us, who want to cleanse this world of scum..."</p><p></p><p>Infected by Zhi Peng's passion, those around him stepped forward vowing to help him eliminate the royals.</p><p></p><p>Though they still felt it was an impossible task, among friends the key was a shared sense of justice. Whether or not they succeeded could be discussed later, but for now they could not let their good friend down.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng took a deep breath and extended his fist. "From today onward, we will be the Illumination Society, letting light shine across the land and dispel all darkness."</p><p></p><p>With blood boiling, they all extended their fists together, shouting in unison, "Let the light shine across the land!"</p><p></p><p>Just as they were fired up by their passionate sense of justice, a clear voice rang out from the side, "The Illumination Society, perhaps I can offer you some assistance."</p><p></p><p>"Who??"</p><p></p><p>The unfamiliar voice startled them greatly. The passion in their chests was instantly doused like cold water over their heads. They turned to see a towering figure, three meters tall in glistening armor, standing there imposingly.</p><p></p><p>Their first thought was that people from the Mage Association had caught up to them. On instinct, they shifted to shield Zhi Peng in the middle. The ponytailed girl was closest, sticking by Zhi Peng protectively.</p><p></p><p>"Air Seal!" "Iron Coffin!"</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Two iron plates slammed together with a tremendous rumbling sound.</p><p></p><p>"Lightning Flash!"</p><p></p><p>A bluish-purple bolt of lightning shot from a Thunder Primal Mage's hand, striking the heavy iron coffin.</p><p></p><p>A Gold Primal Mage stretched out his hand.</p><p></p><p>Pu pu pu!</p><p></p><p>A barrage of spikes erupted from the ground, viciously piercing into the iron coffin. If there was someone inside, they would surely be a pincushion by now.</p><p></p><p>The ponytailed girl asked, "Got him?"</p><p></p><p>The burly Gold Mage guffawed, "Normally, yes. Not many could escape our ambush. This armored guy is impressive, appearing beside us without a sound. Terrifying that none of us noticed him."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhi Peng's heart, which had jumped to his throat, finally settled back down.</p><p></p><p>Then someone wondered, "But didn't he just say he wanted to help us?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, sneaking around scaring people, he deserved to get taken out."</p><p></p><p>"This armor does seem a bit familiar, like I've seen it somewhere before."</p><p></p><p>"Now that you mention it...could it be the 'Earth Scraper Victor' hung in the association hall?"</p><p></p><p>As they discussed animatedly, a voice came from within the iron coffin, "Now now, no need for such hostility! Stay calm, I heard you want to kill all the royals and I'm quite interested in your proposal! Perhaps I can lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>Then, before their very eyes, the 'Earth Scraper Victor' simply stepped out of the iron coffin as if it were air, exuding an oppressive aura.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were stunned. The Air and Gold Mages attacked again, unleashing a barrage of air blades and steel needles that all struck true. Yet the attacks seemed to have no effect, passing through the 'Earth Scraper Victor' like air and blasting a large hole in the wall behind him.</p><p></p><p>The Gold Mage's expression changed. "This 'Earth Scraper Victor' is just like the legends, a Spatial-type Primal Mage of Illusion. Normal attacks are ineffective. Xiao Hui, A Ming!"</p><p></p><p>The ponytailed girl Xiao Hui and the long-haired man guarding Zhi Peng immediately used their own abilities.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Hui covered her face with both hands. "Wailing Sorrow!"</p>

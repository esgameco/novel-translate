        <h1>Chapter 678</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao knew that the brief report from the captain was actually just to reconfirm the authenticity of the news from him.</p><p></p><p>He did not disappoint everyone, saying in a calm tone: "I piloted a fighter jet to break through the enemy's octopus fighter line, entered their rear, and shot and killed all the Octarians on the enemy ship. I confirmed there were no survivors."</p><p></p><p>Silence!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "What I say is true, you can send people to board the enemy ship and investigate."</p><p></p><p>They were already doing that, but it probably hadn't happened that quickly yet.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stopped talking and turned to look at the monitoring screen.</p><p></p><p>Their thoughts differed, but without exception, they all hoped what Su Hao said was true, as this involved the lives of everyone on the spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>But even after hearing Su Hao admit it in person, they still found it hard to convince themselves. They preferred to believe it was a dream, and perhaps they would wake up soon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, no one asked Su Hao how he did it, and no one questioned his words.</p><p></p><p>Not only because Su Hao's strength had been recognized by everyone based on his recent performance, but also because everyone knew that questioning would serve no purpose.</p><p></p><p>Time passed second by second.</p><p></p><p>They watched with their own eyes as the fighter squadrons annihilated the remaining octopus fighters, then approached the motionless warship, and flew into the hole opened at the rear...</p><p></p><p>At this point, an inexplicable sense of joy welled up in everyone's heart, and gradually grew.</p><p></p><p>Because they knew that what Su Hao said was very likely true.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the joy turned into deep puzzlement, and they couldn't help glancing at Su Hao with looks of shock, as if looking at an inhuman monster.</p><p></p><p>His shooting was accurate, so they didn't say anything about that. But now using fighter jets to kill the Octarians on the ship? Was that scientific?</p><p></p><p>Soon, footage shot by the pilots who entered the warship was transmitted back.</p><p></p><p>Many areas inside the enemy warship were in disarray, as if plowed through by a powerful energy cannon. On the metal walls, in addition to pockmarks from bullets, there were scattered Octarian limbs and chunks of flesh, as well as blue-green fluid...</p><p></p><p>It was confirmed that all the Octarians on the warship had been killed!</p><p></p><p>Everyone suddenly turned to look at Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were wide open, full of question marks.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed: "Don't be surprised, officers. You know me, I shoot accurately, so this outcome is normal!"</p><p></p><p>The captain and others: "......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The battle was over, ending in a way no one could have imagined.</p><p></p><p>When all the pilots and crew returned to the Yaoxing spacecraft after the battle was officially declared over, everyone felt like they were in a dream.</p><p></p><p>Their minds were filled only with the image of Su Hao piloting his fighter, weaving recklessly through the enemy fighters.</p><p></p><p>It was too absurd!</p><p></p><p>The battle was over, but not really over, as there was still much work to do in wrapping things up, such as boarding the enemy ship to clear it out, obtain information and resources, and most importantly, acquire their technology.</p><p></p><p>Humans didn't have many opportunities to obtain an intact Octarian raider warship, mostly just shattered debris.</p><p></p><p>This time, having obtained this massive warship, if they could grasp its technology, it would certainly allow human spacecraft technology to advance to new heights.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they could not take it away, only dismantle as many important components as possible.</p><p></p><p>After this battle, the captain immediately convened an official meeting with all the senior officers to analyze and plan the Yaoxing's next movements.</p><p></p><p>For now, they had no time to study the process of this battle, because for them, the present and future have always been more important than the past.</p><p></p><p>As for how Su Hao managed to wipe out all the Octarians on the enemy ship, that wasn't urgent. After all, Su Hao was right there on the ship, he couldn't run away.</p><p></p><p>This suited Su Hao's intentions perfectly. At his strong request, the captain personally approved five days of leave for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao returned to his quarters, but the door wouldn't close properly no matter how many times he tried, so he messaged Captain Yan: "Captain, my door is broken, how do I request repairs?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan: "......"</p><p></p><p>He had kicked it broken himself, but Yan didn't say that. "Just bear with it for now, it will probably take a few days before they can repair it. No one will enter your quarters anyway, why lock it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "That's not right, someone must have entered my quarters, otherwise how did the door get broken?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan didn't respond further, only sending Su Hao the repair request procedures.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao closed the door and lay down on the bed, letting out a long breath. "So that's why, if you want time, you still have to work for it yourself!"</p><p></p><p>If he had encountered this reincarnation situation a few worlds ago, he definitely would have just reincarnated again without a word.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes, sensing the state of his body, finding that his spiritual energy and blood qi were somewhat depleted, and his whole body was sending signals of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he decided to go get some food first, eat his fill, then sleep.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the mess hall was serving food, that wasn't even a question...</p><p></p><p>He was a war hero who had just won a great victory, how could they not even give him a meal?</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao woke up, he immediately began converting his blood qi, preparing the startup energy to set up the 'focus system' to obtain sources.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the intensity of the blood qi in his body reached the level required for Su Hao to activate it.</p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged on the bed, adjusted his physical and mental state, then extended his right hand, constructing a small world in his palm.</p><p></p><p>The small world was not large, only about 200 square meters, but it was more than enough space to set up the 'focus system'.</p><p></p><p>He first used radar to scan the spacecraft, finding no one nearby, then got up and threw all the other three beds and miscellaneous items in the room into the small world.</p><p></p><p>After throwing everything he could, he placed the small world on the bed, flashed into the small world himself, leaving the quarters completely empty.</p><p></p><p>After entering the small world, Su Hao sat cross-legged in midair, arranged all the miscellaneous items, then his blood qi suddenly surged out, scattering according to a certain structure, gradually constructing a not-too-large 'focus system'.</p><p></p><p>After triple-checking that there were no errors, he pointed with one finger to activate the focus system.</p><p></p><p>He himself remained still in the small world, constantly observing the operation of the focus system.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to a focus system constructed with spiritual energy, one made of blood qi is less efficient."</p><p></p><p>Having gotten used to being able to convert matter into sources in just a few seconds, Su Hao now had to wait patiently, which made him feel a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the so-called aftermath of gaining strength...</p><p></p><p>After becoming extremely powerful, then losing that power again, one would inevitably feel very uneasy, with everything feeling off.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, Su Hao's eyes suddenly opened. "It's done!"</p><p></p><p>He then deactivated the focus system and lightly tapped the miscellaneous items that had served as the focus point.</p><p></p><p>"Shua la~"</p><p></p><p>The items Su Hao tapped emitted a familiar dazzling white light, engulfing them.</p><p></p><p>When the white light dissipated, there were more than a dozen low-quality source pearls floating in front of Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Even though I can sense it's only been about a month, I still want to say, long time no see!"</p><p></p><p>He reached out and took a source pearl, carefully sensing its unique source properties, unable to stop the smile that appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Holding the source pearl in his hand, he was about to become invincible!</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll use part of the sources to convert into spiritual energy, then use that spiritual energy to set up a more efficient 'focus system' to convert more sources!"</p><p></p><p>The proverbial snowball effect!</p><p></p><p>Step one, begin constructing a spiritual energy 'hybrid converter'.</p><p></p><p>It was built successfully about a minute later.</p><p></p><p>Step two, the most critical step, converting the sources into specific compounds.</p><p></p><p>He extracted the sources from the source pearls, and after conversion, slowly input them into the 'hybrid converter', more and more.</p><p></p><p>Under his control, the sources gradually cooled and converted into specific compounds, and a colorful small ball appeared above his palm, about the size of a fist.</p><p></p><p>Step three, step-by-step combining the compounds into usable spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the small ball started turning golden, giving off a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at the spiritual energy ball in his hand with a delighted expression, but soon shook his head. "My past self could complete converting sources into spiritual energy in just twenty seconds, but now it takes nearly five minutes... quite a big difference!"</p><p></p><p>The root cause was that Su Hao's spiritual energy had not yet recovered to his previous peak, and the recovery of spiritual energy was limited by the physical body. In summary, for him to fully recover, he would need to undergo at least a year of bitter cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After waiting a bit longer, once the golden light ball stabilized, he deactivated the spatial barrier and absorbed the manifested spiritual energy from his palm into his body.</p><p></p><p>He quickly closed his eyes, entering a meditative state, focused on circulating the spiritual energy he had just absorbed, beginning to lay his foundation!</p><p></p><p>Since he could casually convert spiritual energy now, what need did he have for something like the Qi Condensation realm?</p><p></p><p>Laying the foundation directly was the true path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>One day to lay the foundation, one day to form his Nascent Soul, one day to form his Yuan Ying!</p><p></p><p>Invincible!</p>

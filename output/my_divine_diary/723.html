        <h1>Chapter 723</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the beginning, when Feng Cheng was hiding his form and stealing energy blocks, the Eight-Armed Clan did not discover his existence.</p><p></p><p>But after the Eight-Armed Clan found that someone had stolen a large number of energy blocks, Feng Cheng could no longer hide. He was tightly locked onto by some kind of reconnaissance means of the Eight-Armed Clan. Basically, wherever he went, the Eight-Armed Clan's attacks followed.</p><p></p><p>Until he infiltrated the underground depths, he found that the Eight-Armed Clan seemed to have lost track of him.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps they thought he had already been taken care of?</p><p></p><p>Previously, without spatial abilities, it would not have been easy for him to take down all the spaceships floating in the sky. However, now his assistant had gained an ability called the 'Energy Burst Wave'. To take down spaceships powered by energy blocks would be a breeze.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng no longer concealed himself, but instead used the 'Lightfoot' sequence ability to separate his body into a diffuse smoke, quietly flying up into the sky while constructing the 'Energy Burst Wave' rune.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he hid within a wisp of cloud, gazing at the vast number of spaceships outside in space.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, before launching his attack, he sent Su Hao a message: "Big Boss Su, can I use the 'Energy Burst Wave' on the Eight-Armed Clan's colony planet now? I'm worried that after I use it, it will draw the Eight-Armed Clan's attention and expose our abilities, affecting our subsequent plans."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly replied: "It's okay, even if you use it, they won't be able to confirm what went wrong. It's not that easy to expose us. And before leaving, just drop a 'Star Shard Cube' to destroy everything."</p><p></p><p>With reassurance, Feng Cheng replied: "Understood, Big Boss Su."</p><p></p><p>He turned his head again to look at the various spaceships in space, revealing a ferocious smile: "Here I come!"</p><p></p><p>With that, a huge runic array first aimed at the largest mothership.</p><p></p><p>'Activate!'</p><p></p><p>In less than ten seconds, a dazzling burst of fire suddenly appeared in space.</p><p></p><p>The mothership and the surrounding ships were abruptly engulfed in violent explosions, instantly turning into a pile of space debris.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Clan inside the ships probably didn't even know what had happened before plunging into total darkness.</p><p></p><p>The sudden explosion of the mothership caught all the Eight-Armed Clan off guard, the flashing light causing their thoughts to momentarily stall.</p><p></p><p>And it was in this moment of stalling that Feng Cheng swept the runic array across the spaceships in space, as if sweeping the floor.</p><p></p><p>The ships swept over erupted in bright flashes of light, like blooming fireworks in space.</p><p></p><p>It was like using a flamethrower to spray the swarming mosquitoes in the air - with a crackling sound, they all turned into piles of cinders.</p><p></p><p>Except the explosions of the spaceships did not carry back a single sound.</p><p></p><p>Watching the scene before him, Feng Cheng was full of excitement, unable to stop himself from exclaiming: "So awesome! The skill created by Big Boss Su is ridiculously powerful."</p><p></p><p>He then sent the video he recorded to the group chat, along with a thumbs up: "Awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao just smiled when he saw it.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan replied with a dazed expression.</p><p></p><p>After realizing the danger, the spaceships in space tried to turn around and leave, but how could they outrun Feng Cheng's runic sweeps?</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "Who cares if I drop bombs now?"</p><p></p><p>Let's go!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the meeting room of the Eight-Armed Clan's colony fortress, all the Eight-Armed Clan stared blankly at the 3D image displaying the scene. No matter how the communications officer called the spaceships, there was no response.</p><p></p><p>Doubts popped into their minds: "What happened? Why did the spaceships suddenly explode? This can't be real, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Clan Ball Leader was also dazed. After coming to his senses, he immediately shouted and yelled for someone to confirm what had happened.</p><p></p><p>But the clear image gave him an ominous premonition: his fleet might be doomed!</p><p></p><p>This time, whether or not they succeeded in eliminating the Crystal Demon, he would suffer heavy losses, and he would inevitably become a laughingstock among the other Ball Leaders.</p><p></p><p>He could already imagine being mocked when meeting with the other Ball Leaders.</p><p></p><p>"My 'Trigger' is ruined!"</p><p></p><p>Soon after, another piece of bad news came: another Eight-Armed Clan city had been destroyed!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, an Eight-Armed Clan proposed: "Mobilize the mothership from Blood Harbor and use the Planet Buster Cannon on him. That should be able to take him out!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Clan Ball Leader's blood boiled, and he instinctively wanted to lash out again. If the Planet Buster Cannon hit, how much would this planet be worth? No one would buy it then!</p><p></p><p>Things had come to this point, and he had realized that his losses were inevitable - it was just a matter of how much.</p><p></p><p>Being hit by the Planet Buster Cannon was better than having the Crystal Demon destroy all the cities on the entire planet, right? As long as they lowered the power of the Planet Buster Cannon a bit...</p><p></p><p>Right now, he just wanted that terrifyingly powerful Crystal Demon to die immediately.</p><p></p><p>As for the Eight-Armed Clan who would die from the Planet Buster Cannon's collateral damage, he could no longer care too much. If he hesitated further, the Crystal Demon might soon come right over their heads and drop bombs.</p><p></p><p>If he himself died, then what use was the planet?</p><p></p><p>If they waited for the Crystal Demon to reach their side, by then they might not even have a chance to use the Planet Buster Cannon.</p><p></p><p>After weighing it for a moment and realizing that their lives were more important, he thought he could just ask his grandfather to buy him another planet...</p><p></p><p>He suddenly stood up, waving his tentacles and screeching: "Contact the Harbor Mothership and blast him to death!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was unaware of what awaited him next, only focused on enjoying himself, dropping one bomb after another on the Eight-Armed Clan's cities.</p><p></p><p>By now, he had lost track of how many bombs he had dropped and how many cities he had destroyed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that after destroying all of the Eight-Armed Clan's spaceships, there was no longer any means that could pose a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>After dropping another bomb to destroy an Eight-Armed Clan city, he floated in the air and waited for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Frowning, he said: "My spiritual power consumption has reached the warning line. If I can't find the location of the spatial disruptor, I can only hide and recover my spiritual power before continuing the search."</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Clan's spatial disruptors also varied in strength. Those installed on spaceships were low-powered spatial disruptors that could only disrupt a small area of space, preventing ships within the range from entering warp.</p><p></p><p>For these small spatial disruptors, even if there was only one, it could greatly limit Feng Cheng's ability to teleport freely. But if he really exerted himself, he still had the ability to pry open space and transmit away.</p><p></p><p>However, the spatial disruptor installed on a planet, when operating at full power, could cover other planets within the same star system. Under such spatial disruption, Feng Cheng's spiritual tentacles would be unable to effectively pry open space.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the spatial disruptor deployed on this Eight-Armed Clan colony planet must be a planetary-class one.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng could only find and destroy the disruptor before he could leave this planet.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to continue searching, he sensed something and instinctively looked up, squinting at the sky.</p><p></p><p>He saw a white dot gradually enlarging in his vision and wondered: "What is that, an attack from a spaceship? It seems the Eight-Armed Clan hasn't given up yet! I underestimated them!"</p><p></p><p>But Feng Cheng wouldn't be careless, immediately flying away from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could fly far, the white dot had already drawn near, suddenly becoming immense, almost covering a 20-kilometer range, leaving him no room to evade.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was dumbfounded: "What the heck is that?"</p><p></p><p>Then he was engulfed by the massive beam of light.</p>

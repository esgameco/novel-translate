        <h1>Chapter 638</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The results of the sample comparison came out quickly.</p><p></p><p>In each round of replication, there would be a slight deviation between the sub-replicate and the previous level replicate. Replicating two or three times didn't have much impact, but after continuous replication to six or seven times, the slight deviations accumulated, forming a big problem.</p><p></p><p>For this extremely precise 'planet virus', it can be said that it almost cannot tolerate even the slightest deviation - a tiny discrepancy leads to a huge error!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao exclaimed: "To destroy a planet is indeed not that simple!"</p><p></p><p>It's just like human cells. Each replication causes some damage to the cells. When the number of replications reaches a certain level, the cells will inevitably age and die, or proliferate uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Since the problem was identified, how should it be solved?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly came up with a solution: add a self-check and adjustment program after replication is completed.</p><p></p><p>The idea is that after replication is done, instead of hastily activating the 'random gate' program for transfer, first conduct a comparison self-check to confirm that the replicate is consistent with the previous level virus original without any deviation.</p><p></p><p>If there is a deviation, it needs to self-adjust first, continue to activate the self-check, and only after the self-check program meets the standard can the 'random gate' program be activated to disperse the replication work.</p><p></p><p>The 'planet virus' is after all different from human cells. Cells cannot add a self-detection program or self-regulate.</p><p></p><p>But this 'planet virus', a human creation, can be modified at will. Almost any desired function can be realized, as long as the thinking process is logical.</p><p></p><p>After figuring out the cause and thinking through the solution, Su Hao entered the pinball space and began designing the latest version of the 'planet virus'.</p><p></p><p>After this production is successful, it will be updated to version 3.3!</p><p></p><p>Just need to keep updating and fine-tuning to achieve the final result.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao worked with an unconscious victorious smile: "One punch to explode a planet, achieved in one go!"</p><p></p><p>The grievances from the previous life will now be completely paid back!</p><p></p><p>However, the progress of the 'planet virus' was much slower than he had imagined. After solving one problem, the next time, a new problem would appear again...</p><p></p><p>Version 3.3...</p><p>Version 3.31...</p><p>Version 4.0... </p><p>Version 6.0...</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, another five years passed. After repeatedly updating the 'planet virus', Su Hao updated it to version 7.5.3.</p><p></p><p>"This time it should work, right? It's been sixty years now, if it still doesn't work, the disaster might come..."</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao didn't expect was that just designing a virus would cost him so much time, it was outrageous, even more difficult than when he was researching to break through the 'Perception Platform' to the divine realm!</p><p></p><p>He could be called a master mechanic.</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was about to try it out on the Key Star, Feng Cheng sent a message: "Old Master Wei, that guy A Star couldn't get up from the toilet yesterday and was even mocked by his grandson asking if he was about to die. Today he's gone!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao touched the bright and solid outer shell of the 'planet virus' and replied: "Got it, let's go take a look later!"</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Su Hao walked out of the lab and saw Ya Shan and Feng Cheng waiting outside the door. </p><p></p><p>The three went to the outskirts of Huai Shui Town and slowly entered this initial place.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Huai Shui Town had become a bit more prosperous. At least the road leading to the small town was no longer pitted, but a flat concrete highway that vehicles could travel freely on.</p><p></p><p>But the overall layout hadn't changed much, even Su Hao's former two-story small building was still standing quietly.</p><p></p><p>What changed was the people!</p><p></p><p>Just as the poem goes: "The flowers look similar year after year, but people change year after year."</p><p></p><p>Now the last two familiar people in the small town, A Star and A Wang, only A Wang was left!</p><p></p><p>They came to A Star's small courtyard and entered.</p><p></p><p>A Star had just passed away and hadn't had time to deal with the funeral matters, just lying quietly on the bed.</p><p></p><p>A Star's wife Xiao Kong was also quite elderly, her cloudy eyes a bit moist. A Wang was also sitting there silently with Qing Qing accompanying him.</p><p></p><p>When A Star's family members were there when he left, they all stayed by his side. This could also be considered another kind of blessing.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao and the other two came in, it drew their attention. A Wang raised his head and said unclearly: "A...A Yang, A Shan...Feng, you're here!"</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing those three youthful and energetic faces, everyone inevitably showed an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Even A Star's grandson knew of the existence of Su Hao and the others, because A Star and A Wang's favorite thing to do was to tell others their heroic stories from the past.</p><p></p><p>Who were Su Hao and the other two?</p><p></p><p>They were peers of A Star and A Wang, teammates of their grandfathers...</p><p></p><p>It was outrageous!</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he didn't continue.</p><p></p><p>For A Wang, this was good enough. And, there was no opportunity anymore.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the others stayed for a while, then left! Regardless, they were ultimately not of the same world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Back at the base, Su Hao didn't rush to test the 7.5.3 version of the 'planet virus'. Instead, he followed Ya Shan into the base to check on the progress of the spacecraft construction.</p><p></p><p>In the extremely vast and huge underground cavity of the small world base, as Ya Shan led Su Hao to inspect, he explained: "Old Master Wei, now the overall frame of the spacecraft has basically been completed and has entered the strength testing phase. If the test is passed, then we'll start assembling the corresponding modules from the outside through the teleportation array for assembly. Soon it will have the appearance of a spacecraft!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao just casually looked, without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan continued: "By the way Old Master Wei, our small world base looks like a ball with only a three-meter diameter from the outside. I plan to build a carrying frame for it. Here are various design options for you to see if they meet your taste."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Ya Shan sent various spacecraft designs to the group.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately exclaimed: "This one is good, metallic feel, the swept wing armor is just right, ferocious and powerful yet not lacking beauty, the lines are smooth and sci-fi, instantly hitting my heart...</p><p></p><p>Wow! This one with the missile shape is not bad either, piercing through the darkness of the universe as it shuttles!</p><p></p><p>This teardrop shape one is also awesome, best to draw shark teeth on it!</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng thought every design was great, he wanted every one!</p><p></p><p>The exterior may be small, but the key is to be powerful!</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "The detection range has expanded to the asteroid belt outside this star system, but no anomalies have been found."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't care, only nodding: "Keep monitoring."</p><p></p><p>Then he continued strolling leisurely. </p><p></p><p>The workers he met along the way all greeted him respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not many people recognized Su Hao. As time passed, fewer and fewer people knew about Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>The wanted poster of the 'Earth Scraper' that used to hang in the lobby of the Mage Association seemed to have become a figure from myth and legend.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Su Hao brought the 7.5.3 version of the 'planet virus' and teleported to the Key Star, then casually threw down the ellipsoid virus.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully this time...never mind, no need to say it. If it succeeds, it succeeds. If not, I'll try again. It's not like if I hope for it to succeed, it will succeed!"</p><p></p><p>"Activate!"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Su Hao, the 'planet virus' he threw down instantly exploded...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 928</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>There were a total of twenty galaxies, ten of which had reached dynamic equilibrium, while the other ten had not reached balance. Suhao went through the entire process meticulously, carefully testing whether his conclusions were correct.</p><p></p><p>Such as sending transcendent disciples, dropping shattered star cubes, utilizing the source produced by shattered stars to transform into pure energy to impact the stars...</p><p></p><p>All the results were consistent with what he had envisioned.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I find a way to fully control the 'line of fate', my main body will no longer be limited to the second-level world."</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was no difference between using his divine avatar or his own body now. Even if he solved the problem of the ill-fate system, he would still hide his main body in the second-level world, just in case.</p><p></p><p>After all, Suhao himself could not say for sure whether there were other dangers in the universe.</p><p></p><p>But solving the ill-fate system could still resolve one of his worries, making his body and mind freer.</p><p></p><p>"Not only that, if I solve the problem of the ill-fate system, I may even be able to use the 'line of fate' to achieve certain special effects. For example, a luck curse, an ill-fate curse, the pursuit of the Grim Reaper. Who knows, in the future I may even be able to catalyze the so-called 'Goddess of Fortune' and 'God of Ill-fate'."</p><p></p><p>He could think of too many uses for such a profound and mysterious ability.</p><p></p><p>After completing the experiments to verify the line of fate, Suhao returned to his experimental base and entered the pinball space, recording the experimental results while beginning to design the next research plan.</p><p></p><p>He planned to re-select a galaxy with a line of fate and begin researching the mechanism of the line of fate.</p><p></p><p>His research process was somewhat crude: First, use the shattered star cubes to wreak havoc in the galaxy, smashing one star after another, even planning to change the orbits of planets, pushing them towards the stars and giving the stars a big bang, trying to use violence to disrupt the dynamic equilibrium of the galaxy and observe the rhythm and manner of its recovery;</p><p></p><p>Third, observe the way the energy feedback comes back, find the pulsating pattern of the 'line of fate', and try to actively control the 'line of fate'...</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, he planned to use brute force first. If violence could not solve the problem, he would then work on it from a more meticulous aspect.</p><p></p><p>In fact, at this stage, Suhao was no longer in a hurry. He had already figured out the basic principle of the 'ill-fate system', which could be considered solving his personal crisis from the root. He had plenty of time in the future to study the laws of galaxies, and even the laws of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Balance is such a wondrous thing."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suhao happily completed the experiments and then left, leaving behind twenty disciples who were utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>This mission had completely exceeded their existing cognition.</p><p></p><p>Never mind seeing the legendary 'Master Wei', the most crucial thing was that they had witnessed the destruction of a planet with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Turmoil, expansion, turning into flowing metal eggs, then transforming into an ocean with white pearls, and finally becoming a cosmic sword that sliced through the deep starry sky until it completely disappeared...</p><p></p><p>That was an enormously huge planet, an invincible and aloof existence in the universe. They believed that even if they used all their strength and unleashed their most powerful skills, they could only make a tiny dent on the planet's surface...</p><p></p><p>They knew their master and grand masters were powerful, powerful to an incomprehensible degree. In the eyes of the disciples, Suhao and the others were celestial beings born from the quintessence of trillions of rules in the universe. But they had never imagined that these three deities could so easily destroy such an enormously huge planet.</p><p></p><p>In their view, no matter how powerful a life form was, it was still just one life! How could a single life shake a planet that had been floating almost eternally in the universe?</p><p></p><p>The stronger they cultivated, the more they realized the low possibility of achieving such a feat.</p><p></p><p>The most likely way to destroy a planet would be to use the "leverage" mindset of formations, probe the internal structure of the planet, borrow force to apply force, and unleash corresponding structural skills to disintegrate the planet from the inside, causing it to completely explode and be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>But doing so, the shattered planetary material would still re-coalesce under the force of gravity, forming another planet.</p><p></p><p>At most, it could only destroy the original environment of the planet, but not make it disappear into a stream of light like what they had witnessed.</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock subsided, the puzzled disciples went to inquire with their respective masters.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei found Feng Cheng, hesitating about how to ask.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng glanced at the two and curiously asked, "What's wrong? You look like you've lost your souls. Oh, give me back the locator stones I gave you!"</p><p></p><p>The two reluctantly returned Suhao's locator stones to Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling hesitated for a moment, then mustered her courage to ask, "Master, in the mission you assigned us, I saw Grand Master Wei. I also saw him...destroy a planet. How...did he do that?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was stunned, then laughed, "What's so strange about that? I've completely destroyed no less than a hundred planets with my own hands."</p><p></p><p>"Sheeshâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The two siblings gasped in shock, staring at their master in amazement. They never expected their gentle and sunny master to be such a planet-busting badass, whose mild appearance completely belied his tendency to casually blow up planets.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling couldn't help but ask in a low voice, "Master, are you really a celestial deity who has grasped the rules of the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Her expression was like saying, 'Tell us secretly, we won't spread it around.'</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed heartily, "You can guess, but I won't admit it. Hahaha! But don't think of us as too powerful. We're actually still very weak, just small 'wanderers of the starry sky'. If we were all-knowing and all-powerful, why would we need to cultivate you? It's precisely because there are many things we cannot do that we need your help. It's just that you are still too weak at the moment."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei then curiously asked, "Master, what were those metal ellipsoids I saw on the planet? Why did the entire planet turn into that form?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng glanced at the two, then grinned mischievously, "That was a virus."</p><p></p><p>"A virus??"</p><p></p><p>The two siblings were instantly horrified.</p><p></p><p>They now had celestial bodies and no longer needed to worry about viral infections, but that didn't stop their fear of viruses.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei asked in puzzlement, "Master, didn't you teach us that viruses are invisible? How could there be such a huge virus?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "How could the viruses in our biological bodies be the same as those specifically prepared for planets?"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Feng Cheng took out a shattered star cube and demonstrated, "This is the seed of the planet virus, called a shattered star cube. Just drop it onto a planet, and you can easily destroy it. Want one?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei, recalling the scene of the entire planet flowing with metal ellipsoids, immediately shook their heads, "No...just curious."</p><p></p><p>But they were still amazed as they leaned their heads towards the cube to examine it closely.</p><p></p><p>As they looked, they confirmed that this cube was indeed identical to the one Suhao had dropped on the planet. However, no matter how they looked at it, they couldn't find anything unusual about it. Wasn't this just like an ordinary small metal block?</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei marveled, "Just this little thing can destroy an entire planet? Unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "I can make this thing, but as for what principle it operates on, only your Grand Master Wei knows clearly. Even I find it a bit hazy and only know the general idea. This is one of the highest levels of knowledge. With your current level of knowledge, you're still far from it."</p><p></p><p>The two siblings were stunned, "Even you don't know, Master?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng put away the cube and laughed, "Or did you think who Grand Master Wei is? In my eyes, there is nothing that can surpass Grand Master Wei, not even this universe. Everything he has seen will eventually be conquered by Grand Master Wei. If you live long enough, you will definitely see that day."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the mysterious and powerful image of Suhao spread widely among Yashuan and Feng Cheng's disciples.</p><p></p><p>All the disciples wanted to see in person what the legendary 'Grand Master Wei' looked like.</p><p></p><p>The more it was passed down, the more mystical it became, earning him the title of 'Master of the Cosmic Cycle'.</p>

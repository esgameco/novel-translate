        <h1>Chapter 893</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Observing the fluctuations of the ominous energy waves, Suhao gained a deeper understanding of the ominous system, feeling extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>This was the feeling of progress.</p><p></p><p>"The wave patterns and ominous energy may not be viewed independently. The wave patterns are merely a phenomenon I observed through the Seeker of Nothingness. They cannot represent the entirety of the ominous system.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter what, I must first map out the complete wave pattern diagram for the Xianghu Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had come up with a brilliant idea. As long as the intensity of the wave patterns was strong enough, he could successfully map out the wave pattern diagrams by galactic units.</p><p></p><p>The method was actually quite simple - he just needed to place sufficiently large volumes of the Seeker of Nothingness material in all the galactic systems within the Xianghu Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>This way, he could see all the wave patterns within range in real-time.</p><p></p><p>The principle was simple. First, the reason why he could see the wave patterns: The Seeker of Nothingness was a material born under intense ominous forces. Under the influence of the wave patterns, it would move in a unique pattern. After Suhao analyzed the motion of the Seeker of Nothingness, he created a spiritual eye and integrated it into his brain.</p><p></p><p>So the fundamental reason Suhao could see the wave patterns was the unique motion of the internal particles of the Seeker of Nothingness under the influence of the wave patterns.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as he could control the motion of the Seeker of Nothingness in real-time, and then convert and simulate it through the Ballistic Space, he could obtain the patterns of the wave patterns.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Seeker of Nothingness was loaded into a physical body was not the most important factor.</p><p></p><p>"The next step is to deploy the Seeker of Nothingness and devices to collect its motion data within all galactic systems in the Xianghu Galaxy. Then I'll directly send the companion devices to the various galactic systems and wait for the data collection to complete.</p><p></p><p>Once the data is collected, I can simulate the complete wave patterns in reverse."</p><p></p><p>After Suhao thought through the plan, he immediately took action, entering the Ballistic Space to design the motion data collection devices compatible with the Seeker of Nothingness.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, he completed the device design and then went to the experimental micro-world to start production.</p><p></p><p>Half a year passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Suhao had also completed the production of the "Wave Pattern Data Collection Devices."</p><p></p><p>They looked like satellites floating in space, with an enormous volume. The main material inside was the Seeker of Nothingness, while the outer layer was engraved gold that could remain uncorroded and undeformed for thousands of years in any environment. In between was the data collection device.</p><p></p><p>After testing, once the wave pattern intensity reached a certain level, this set of devices could fully record the wave pattern diagram of an entire galactic system.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself, "The entire Xianghu Galaxy probably has about one trillion galactic systems, which means I need to produce at least one trillion sets of these devices..."</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about the sheer concept of "one trillion" made Suhao's scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>Although many devices could be directly converted from source energy, Suhao felt he couldn't handle the quantity of one trillion, so it would be more comfortable to set up an automated production line.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he immediately contacted Yashan and Fengcheng through group chat: "Yashan, Fengcheng, hurry back. We need your help setting up a production line. Not too many, about a hundred million production lines should be enough."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he thought, "We really don't have enough manpower now. If I had a hundred or so capable hands under me, it wouldn't come to this. I hope these dimensional travelers can truly grow and become helpers to explore the universe with me.</p><p></p><p>Hmm...having them travel one by one is too slow. I need to find a way to rapidly screen various talents." Such as 'researchers', 'manufacturers', 'explorers', 'collectors'...it would be much more convenient once Yashan and the others create worlds for these roles."</p><p></p><p>When Yashan and Fengcheng heard this, they quickly teleported to Suhao's experimental base.</p><p></p><p>After understanding Suhao's request, Fengcheng widened his eyes: "Whewâ€”produce one trillion devices?"</p><p></p><p>That's an uncountable amount of money.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "First set up the production lines. Once the lines are up, the speed will be faster. By the way, you two can create as many avatars as possible to help, as long as it doesn't affect your world-building. The more the better.</p><p></p><p>As we explore farther and farther, our manpower is becoming insufficient. If you have the opportunity, you two should also take on more apprentices and train them into usable talents so they can join us in exploring the universe in the future."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng looked at each other, seeing the surprise in each other's eyes. "Take on apprentices?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked curiously, "Like Fengyu and the others before?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head. "Not the same. The apprentices we take on now, provided they have mature and reliable mentalities, can receive focused training. We can organize the knowledge we've mastered into systematic teachings for them to accelerate their growth.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I'll grant you two an authority to embed your apprentices with 'all-purpose assistants' of various levels, making it easier to guide and assign tasks. But this isn't urgent - let's produce these one trillion device sets first!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng's eyes widened slightly, sensing something different in Suhao's tone: In the future, this universe would see the emergence of countless powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Suhao took a deep breath and said loudly, "Let's go, Yashan, Fengcheng! Time to work! No matter how much, it won't defeat us!"</p><p></p><p>"Got it, Master Wei! Let's get it done!"</p><p></p><p>There was no need to train other workers anymore. The three of them working together were faster than a massive workforce.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ten years later, the three finally completed setting up the mass production lines. Now, hundreds of thousands of device sets could be assembled daily and sent by their avatars to the corresponding galactic systems to begin operation.</p><p></p><p>But at this pace, it would still take at least a few hundred years to complete everything...</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "The production lines are still not enough. Keep building more."</p><p></p><p>So the three dove back into constructing more production lines, working day and night without rest.</p><p></p><p>This kind of assembly line production work is something ordinary people may not be able to endure for long periods while maintaining efficiency. Only those with exceptionally resilient minds and willpower could do so.</p><p></p><p>This showed that Suhao and the other two were extraordinary individuals.</p><p></p><p>Even if they became ordinary people working in a factory, they would undoubtedly be outstanding.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly one day, Little Light notified Suhao that Cong Shuling and her brother were about to face another ominous crisis.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought, "Here it comes again? This is the third time. After overcoming this crisis, it should be a few decades until the next one. Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>One of his avatars immediately put down the task at hand and teleported to the Crosstar, sweeping with his divine consciousness to quickly lock onto the siblings.</p><p></p><p>After more than a decade of tempering, the two were completely different from the novices they once were, their aura alone revealing their exceptional nature.</p><p></p><p>This time, the task they received was: Within a set time limit, they must annihilate the largest pirate gang in the Heroic World - the Holli Pirate Gang.</p><p></p><p>The Holli Pirate Gang had thousands of men, occupying a cluster of volcanic islands. Extremely vicious and audacious, they dared to attack even the forces of the Eighteen Deities and the Great Demon King Chipu.</p><p></p><p>But this pirate gang was filled with countless experts. Even a small squad leader could be an extraordinarily powerful hero with all kinds of mystical abilities. United, they could force the demon kings under the Great Demon King Chipu to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Using such a formidable pirate gang as a crisis task for the siblings was perfect - exceptionally dangerous.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Deities happened to take this opportunity to eliminate this thorn in their side. They had carefully designed plans and arranged all kinds of coincidences. Even contingency strategies for mid-course changes had been repeatedly simulated.</p><p></p><p>For both Cong Shuling and her brother, as well as the Eighteen Deities, victory was a must this time.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly. Cong Shuling and her brother, clad in battle gear, flew high in the air, gradually approaching the Holli Pirate Gang's base.</p><p></p><p>The elder sister Cong Shuling had an automatic rifle and a rocket launcher on her back, with various grenades and ammunition clips attached to her waist, chest, and back. Two beautiful long swords hung at her waist.</p><p></p><p>The younger brother Cong Renfei shouldered multiple rocket launchers, holding a six-barrel fire cannon in his left hand and carrying thick chains of bullets all over his body.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in addition to the visible equipment, their personal spatial rings were also stuffed with all kinds of weapons. They only carried some on their bodies due to limited space.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Sister, I'm worried our firepower isn't enough. Let's use our remaining points to exchange for two more high-explosive bombs!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling shook her head. "No, we need to save the remaining points for our survival. What we have in our spaces and on us is already sufficient. After we expend all our ammunition, if the problem still isn't resolved, then we'll charge in and take them down one by one.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the ammunition we have is enough to level the entire Holli Volcanic Island! Oh, before we attack, we should destroy their ships first so they can't escape."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Understood, sis!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao watched with eyes twitching. "This is a battle?"</p>

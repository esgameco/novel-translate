        <h1>Chapter 929</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After Suhao emerged from seclusion, Yashan and Fengcheng each sent a clone to wait for him.</p><p></p><p>Only after seeing Suhao walk out of the laboratory with a relaxed expression did they go to greet him.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng exclaimed in amazement, "Grand Master Wei, you were secluded for two hundred years this time! I can't even imagine what life would be like staying inside for two hundred years without going out at all. That's already the span of two ordinary human lifetimes."</p><p></p><p>Even with experimental tasks, he would go out for a stroll to relax every so often. Not to mention two hundred years, Fengcheng didn't think he could endure even fifty years.</p><p></p><p>Yashan also said, "Grand Master Wei's ability to concentrate is truly unmatched. No one can compare. I've tried staying in the laboratory continuously as well, but I couldn't last more than a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "With enough passion and motivation to do something, one can naturally persevere for a longer time. This is only the beginning. Who knows, in the future I may spend even more time researching a single project."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed, "I doubt it. What could be so difficult that it would take Grand Master hundreds of years of dedicated research?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed heartily, "There are many such things. It's not a matter of difficulty, but of quantity. No matter how capable a person is, there are some problems they cannot directly overcome, only patiently wait. For example..."</p><p></p><p>He reached out and grasped at the empty space, "The rhythm of the universe!"</p><p></p><p>"The rhythm of the universe?"</p><p></p><p>The two did not quite understand, but their admiration for Suhao had already reached an incomparable level. They thought inwardly, "It's impossible to comprehend the heights Grand Master has attained..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao withdrew his hand and said, "What about you two? Have you encountered any problems? All these years I've been calculating a set of data and haven't reviewed the logs you uploaded. If there are any issues, you can tell me now."</p><p></p><p>Yashan immediately said, "There is one issue. Years ago, Fengcheng proposed the concept of a 'shuttle craft' with the goal of creating a ship capable of traveling between galaxies, to be given to disciples for exploring unknown celestial domains. We've already made all the other functions, but there's still the problem of the 'landing calculation program' that needs your help to solve."</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked curiously, "Shuttle craft? Take it out and let me see."</p><p></p><p>Yashan then took out a machine resembling a life capsule and explained it to Suhao, then said, "This shuttle craft can accommodate two people. Its main current functions include: starry sky travel, gravitational wave, cone field manipulation, galactic network enhancer, and more. As long as we load the 'network transmission' calculation capability, this shuttle craft will be able to access the galactic network and jump between galaxies."</p><p></p><p>Suhao examined the shuttle craft, also recording it into his bouncing realm space to assist with analysis. At the same time, he was thinking about an issue: "The 'galactic network transmission technology' does require my landing calculation program. Without the corresponding program, network transmission cannot be completed. But this program is still very important to me currently - it's one of my means of self-preservation, so I can't simply import it into this shuttle craft...</p><p></p><p>However, Yashan is also right that if we can't popularize the shuttle craft, it will inevitably slow down our progress in exploring the universe...</p><p></p><p>After all, it's extremely difficult to cultivate a disciple capable of using 'network transmission' to travel within a galaxy, let alone crossing galaxies."</p><p></p><p>Even if he enabled the 'network transmission' function for every transcendent disciple, without the shuttle craft's assistance, interstellar travel would be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he could enable 'network transmission' for all transcendent disciples, but it still wouldn't be as convenient as having the shuttle craft.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Suhao's eyes lit up: "I've got it! I can utilize the principle of mother insect neural synchronization to create a main brain and countless sub-brains.</p><p></p><p>The main brain, like a mother insect, will be hidden in my second-level world, loaded with my 'landing calculation program'. The sub-brains will be installed in each shuttle craft, only with basic programs set.</p><p></p><p>When a shuttle craft prepares to initiate an intergalactic transmission, it will instantly send a 'calculation request' to the main brain. The main brain will complete the calculation and feed the result back to the shuttle craft to complete the transmission. Perfect!"</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Suhao then told Yashan, "There's no problem. I've come up with a solution. You can leave this shuttle craft with me first. I'll make some simple functional additions, and once it's done, you can take it for mass production."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng exchanged a look, with an expression of 'just as we expected'.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng smiled, "Just as Yashan and I expected, problems we can't solve are merely a moment's thought for Grand Master. Once the shuttle craft is made, our exploration efficiency will increase at least a hundredfold."</p><p></p><p>Suhao then asked, "Have you encountered any interesting planets during this period?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan immediately replied, "Yes, we've come across life planets with special abilities, such as liquid life planets, high radiation life planets, photosynthetic animal planets... I've also done some relevant research, but not in-depth enough. I've compiled all the data I obtained and uploaded it to the assistant. If Grand Master is interested, you can take a look."</p><p></p><p>Suhao seemed pleasantly surprised, "Not bad. But no need to rush, I'll take a look after dealing with the matters at hand. Those unique life planets aren't going anywhere."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was also full of interest, "As long as we keep exploring outward, all mysteries will eventually be revealed to us. Just thinking about it feels exciting. What kind of strange planets will we encounter in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "It's like treasure hunting. Before finding it, you can never be certain what the next life planet will look like."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng asked, "Grand Master, Senior Yashan, do you think we have a chance to explore this entire universe?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed heartily, "Probably not. Theoretically, the universe is infinite, which means no matter how far we explore, there will always be places we haven't been. So as long as we're still alive, we might as well keep exploring forward. That makes it even more interesting."</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's also more despairing.</p><p></p><p>Even if they mastered the method of jumping across multiple celestial domains for transmission, they still wouldn't be able to see the true face of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Those trapped on a single planet might actually be the fortunate ones.</p><p></p><p>Knowing less, thinking less, worrying less...</p><p></p><p>But for Yashan and Fengcheng, whether the universe is infinite or not didn't matter. What mattered was striving to learn and progress, and absolutely not being abandoned by Grand Master...</p><p></p><p>Suhao added, "Of course, we can't blindly explore deeper into the universe either, or we'd just become wandering souls drifting aimlessly in the cosmos."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng couldn't help but nod in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked, "Grand Master, will we set our center point in the Xiang Galaxy?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head, "Not necessarily. I haven't made a final decision yet. Actually, I have an idea to create an infinite expanse of land where all the life forms we discover can exist."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were astonished. "Infinite land?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng curiously asked, "Is it by piling up countless planets to form an enormously vast continent?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan shook his head, rejecting Fengcheng's idea. "That's not realistic. Piling up countless planets would inevitably create tremendous gravity. Exceeding a certain mass, they would collapse into various massive celestial bodies, making it impossible for ordinary lifeforms to survive.</p><p></p><p>I think our 'mini-worlds' might be able to achieve this."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "It's not quite what you're imagining. There's no need to modify or move planets. My idea is to use spatial techniques to interconnect all the life planets we encounter, constructing them into an infinitely large composite world.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, when you reach the edge of one planet, you'll seamlessly transition to another planet. Different planets will be connected together, like a single vast continent, ocean, and sky...</p><p></p><p>Each world is independent yet interconnected, together forming a massive world system.</p><p></p><p>First, we'll create a massive core world, like a mother insect's brain core, and keep attaching newly discovered life planets to this core.</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as our pace of exploration never stops, this world system will continue expanding until it becomes infinitely large...</p><p></p><p>In this way, the life planets separated by vast distances in the universe will be connected, no longer drifting alone in the cosmos, unable to escape their own stellar systems...</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is just an idea of mine for now. Whether this engineering feat can be accomplished, I'm not too sure either, but it's worth a try."</p><p></p><p>"Holy crap!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng couldn't help but swear in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Even they, who had seen much in their travels, were stunned by Suhao's idea.</p>

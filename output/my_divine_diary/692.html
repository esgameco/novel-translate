        <h1>Chapter 692</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, Su Hao successfully completed the control program for the "Eight-Armed God".</p><p></p><p>In the ball space, he sat on a custom-made recliner and gave the command: "Little Light, activate the full immersion control program for the 'Eight-Armed God'."</p><p></p><p>"Little Light received."</p><p></p><p>His vision gradually faded to black. </p><p></p><p>The next moment, lying in the small world, a slender pale red six-sided crystal monster suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>This monster was the "Eight-Armed God" that Su Hao had evolved over more than a year.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao raised his right hand, looked down, clenched and unclenched his claws, carefully feeling the sensations coming from his hands. He then extended all the tentacles on his back in front of him, waving them freely according to his will.</p><p></p><p>He spoke out loud: "If it weren't for the control system I designed myself, I would think I had been reincarnated into a monster's body."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he opened his mouth wide and smiled: "Language system test complete, enunciation clear and accurate, no problems."</p><p></p><p>He controlled the "Eight-Armed God" to run and jump around in the small world. Apart from not being used to running on four limbs, it felt no different from controlling his own body.</p><p></p><p>After stopping, he said with some delight: "The control of the 'God' made from the octopus monster is even better than I imagined, it can be considered seamless, much stronger than the 'God' made from my cells in the previous life. This is the advantage of having a rich and complete nervous system."</p><p></p><p>"Next, let me try out the various abilities of the 'Eight-Armed God'."</p><p></p><p>The "Eight-Armed God" possessed all the abilities of the Alien Gene series, although not very powerful, they were all quite bizarre and useful.</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao valued most were the abilities of the "Shen Jia Ren" (God of Armor): 'Protection', 'Domain', and 'Life Force'.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Su Hao, just like using his own skill, he opened a switch in his brain.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the soil under the "Eight-Armed God" instantly turned into pale red crystals, quickly spreading to every corner of the small world.</p><p></p><p>The pale red crystals, like Su Hao's extended hands, transformed into all kinds of shapes under his control: giant hands, swords, chains, dragons and tigers, plants and trees...</p><p></p><p>It was almost as if he could move and shape them at will.</p><p></p><p>In the end, densely packed swords slowly rose from underground, soon breaking away from the ground and floating in mid-air, like using a 'Summon Myriad Swords' skill.</p><p></p><p>These swords looked ordinary on the surface, but had extremely complex internal structures - they were the 'magic weapons' that Su Hao had not used for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"The Vajra Armor Domain is even stronger than the 'Life Seed'."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he waved his hand, and a flying sword fell into his grasp. He swung it backwards.</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>A pale red sword beam flashed, and the lower half of the "Eight-Armed God" was severed.</p><p></p><p>He had actually cut himself in half at the waist!</p><p></p><p>In just two seconds, the lower body regenerated as before. Su Hao tried walking a few steps, and there was no abnormality.</p><p></p><p>"Regenerative ability...as long as the brain isn't instantly destroyed, it's hard to die. Hmm...let me evolve two more and try getting the brain destroyed to see if it can still regenerate! Next, let me try controlling the threads of the 'Tu Si Ren' (Silk Spitter)..."</p><p></p><p>Without any visible action from him, countless invisible fine threads immediately sprayed out from all over his body, instantly turning the entire small world into a grid world.</p><p></p><p>Any movement in this grid world would be transmitted to Su Hao's consciousness through the fine threads.</p><p></p><p>He also had a premonition that with just a thought, these scattered invisible threads could shred everything in sight into pieces.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it's called 'Ever-Changing Wisdom' - this is the feeling of controlling everything with fine threads. Within the range of the threads, all things were like puppets under his control.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity the range of the threads is limited, otherwise with just this ability I could dominate the world. Next, let me try the cell reorganization of the 'Ni Tai Ren' (Mimic)..."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, his body disintegrated like sand, breaking apart piece by piece and dispersing into the air, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the pieces gradually gathered together again, wriggling and transforming into the appearance of the handsome Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao opened his eyes, looked at his human body, and laughed loudly: "The 'God' really seems omnipotent!"</p><p></p><p>From now on, he would walk the world in this form.</p><p></p><p>Then there was the "Qing Ying Ren" (Ethereal) sequence, turning physical into ethereal to be immune to physical attacks;</p><p></p><p>The "Xun Su Ren" (Swift) sequence, with speed so fast the naked eye couldn't capture it, and the ability to deflect projectiles - even the invisible threads of the "Tu Si Ren" could be deflected, giving a sense of being untouchable;</p><p></p><p>The "Da Li Ren" (Mighty) sequence, with limitless strength, able to transform into an invincible giant, charging through everything;</p><p></p><p>Su Hao tried out all the abilities one by one. From the results, the being worthy of the title "God" was indeed extraordinarily powerful.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao evaluated objectively: "If I had to deal with such a 'God', it would probably take me five seconds. It is indeed extremely powerful. Others may not be able to handle it."</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's eyes, the "Eight-Armed God" was a 'multi-functional' warrior. Within a certain range, it could exert extremely powerful forces, but no matter what, it was ultimately just a warrior using physical strength. There was still a gap compared to cultivators or source mages...</p><p></p><p>A celestial cultivator, after a period of probing to fully understand the "Eight-Armed God's" skill characteristics, could defeat, imprison or even kill it.</p><p></p><p>The "God" was powerful, but not invincible.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could think of many ways to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>However, the "Eight-Armed God" was not Su Hao's ultimate embodied form.</p><p></p><p>After all, who says a "God" can't also be a cultivator and a source mage?</p><p></p><p>He planned to load all his innate abilities onto the "Eight-Armed God" as well.</p><p></p><p>Such as being a 'celestial cultivator', having the 'Core Composite Sense Rune', being a 'source mage', and 'spatial abilities'...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stroked his chin in thought: "These abilities are my core. If I can't load them onto the 'Eight-Armed God', then my mobility will inevitably be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it is theoretically feasible. The only difficulty lies in 'spiritual power'."</p><p></p><p>Abilities like 'celestial cultivator', 'source mage', and 'spatial abilities' all require tremendous spiritual power. But the "Eight-Armed God" has no independent consciousness, and its innate spiritual power is extremely weak. To skillfully use these abilities would be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>And the way Su Hao controls the "Eight-Armed God" is essentially like a full immersion virtual game - his own 'divine will' cannot extend out through the "Eight-Armed God".</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a bit, he quickly came up with a solution: "I can use some opportunistic methods. What I want is not for the 'Eight-Armed God' to have extremely powerful spiritual power, but just the spiritual characteristics to use spirit power and spatial abilities!"</p><p></p><p>As he operated the new body, he contemplated the follow-up modification plan and soon had a complete solution in mind.</p><p></p><p>The more he learned, the more solutions he would find for solving problems, and the faster he could come up with them. Dealing with all kinds of difficulties became easier too!</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the research on the "Point Breaking Plane Spirit Method" from the previous world, he might not even be able to take opportunistic measures now.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The success of the "Eight-Armed God" was within Su Hao's expectations, after all he had tried it in the previous world already.</p><p></p><p>But this was not the end goal, there were still many abilities to be loaded, the current "Eight-Armed God" could only be considered barely usable.</p><p></p><p>After getting used to the controls for a while, he entered the modification experiments for the "Eight-Armed God" again.</p><p></p><p>First solve the problem of the "Eight-Armed God's" spiritual characteristics, then load it with spirit power and runes.</p><p></p><p>In just half a year, Su Hao completed the evolution of the "Eight-Armed God's" spiritual power "spatial tentacles", giving it the abilities of 'teleportation' and 'blinking'.</p><p></p><p>Although these two abilities were not smooth to use at first, it was still a good start, and it was easy to imagine they would only get stronger later on.</p><p></p><p>As for advanced spatial applications like 'second-level spaces' and 'small worlds', the "Eight-Armed God's" weak spiritual power was still unable to achieve that.</p><p></p><p>In summary, the current "Eight-Armed God" was serviceable.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll make a breakthrough towards 'divine will' and load the 'celestial cultivator' abilities this morning."</p>

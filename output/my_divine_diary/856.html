        <h1>Chapter 856</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The deities stopped very close to the red giant star, as they sensed Suhao's aura.</p><p></p><p>After they all stopped, they came to Suhao's side and gazed at the red giant star like he did.</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked in surprise, "Why did you stop? Hurry home!"</p><p></p><p>The Order God - Red Light couldn't help but ask, "Lord Lei'an, why did you stop here and not go?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao countered, "I'm not of the same kind as you all, and this is not my homeland, why would I go there?"</p><p></p><p>The deities were speechless.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the deities still not moving, Suhao said, "Don't dilly-dally, open your hearts to embrace your homeland. Hurry up, what kind of person am I that I could deceive you? Rest assured, I haven't personally dismantled your Ten-Colored Plates yet, I can't bear to let you go to your deaths."</p><p></p><p>The deities realized, "That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>With no more doubts in their hearts, they boldly flew towards the red giant star.</p><p></p><p>When they carefully approached the red giant star, they did not feel the raging hot breath of a star, only the raging energy storms sweeping over them. But it did not damage their Ten-Colored Plates.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the closer they got, the more they could feel the restlessness of the sealed White Dwarfs within them, and a strange sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Until they landed on the red giant star without being roasted, they finally confirmed that what Suhao told them was true.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed the homeland where the White Dwarfs were born.</p><p></p><p>Their true selves were actually born in such a place like the apocalyptic purgatory, filled with blinding light, shock waves, and raging firestorms everywhere? A place like this could give birth to life...</p><p></p><p>This "homecoming" journey once again refreshed the deities' understanding of the universe.</p><p></p><p>After all the deities successfully entered the red giant star, Suhao showed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>He flew back to the planet before, placed a positioning stone in a suitable location for easy travel, then transmitted back into the small world and entered the pinball space with his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"The deities have successfully entered the interior of the red giant star. These eighteen deities are now my detectors on the red giant star. Next, I need to carefully write a detection program for efficiency."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After entering the red giant star, the deities tacitly formed teams and did not rashly disperse, warily observing the repetitive scene of destruction around them.</p><p></p><p>After entering, they began to explore. They found the environment was filled with a vast amount of photon-like particles, allowing them to replenish their soul power endlessly. Staying in such an environment meant their soul power was inexhaustible.</p><p></p><p>However, according to Lei'an, there was no rich and diverse "information" here, and staying too long could cause them to fall back into dullness...</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of soul power, it was a treasure trove, but from the perspective of thought, it was a graveyard.</p><p></p><p>The deities felt utterly amazed by everything around them and couldn't help but discuss:</p><p></p><p>"There's just too much soul power here! It's simply inexhaustible, just one breath makes you feel ethereal. We deities are always thinking about devouring each other to obtain their soul power, but we never thought that soul power, this thing, is so abundant in the homeland of the White Dwarfs that there's no need to devour other White Dwarfs at all."</p><p></p><p>The Beauty Goddess Fuer said, "I never imagined I would one day enter a star, such an unimaginably massive celestial body, the pearl of the universe. To be honest, I've had thoughts of self-destruction, thinking that if I didn't want to live anymore in the future, I would choose to end myself. And the way I chose to end myself was to charge into a star and witness its beauty with my own eyes. Who knew stars were actually the homeland of the White Dwarfs."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Lei'an is really too mysterious. Every time I think I understand him, I realize I only understand a tiny part of him."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, do you think Lei'an can enter this red giant star? From the look of his unwillingness to enter himself, I guess he can't come in."</p><p></p><p>"So? What are you trying to say?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, is it possible that we're actually free now?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that's a good thought, you can try it out. I fully support it with a hundred thousand likes."</p><p></p><p>"What should we do next? Just wander around on this massive star?"</p><p></p><p>"Try it myself? I must be crazy to try it myself."</p><p></p><p>"According to Lei'an, we should wait for the assistant's guidance, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you all noticed that although soul power recovers extremely quickly here, it's not actually very comfortable to stay?"</p><p></p><p>The deities sensed it carefully and agreed, "Now that you mention it, that's true."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe we should change locations, just like the Tenth Cross Star. Although there are lakes, deserts, grasslands, forests, and oceans on the Tenth Cross Star, and humans were born from the Tenth Cross Star, not every place is suitable for humans to live. Our current location might just be an area unsuitable for White Dwarfs to live?"</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense, let's change locations then!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as the deities gathered together and randomly chose a direction to explore,</p><p></p><p>All the deities received a prompt from the assistant: "First task generated: Find the gathering place of the White Dwarf race within half a year."</p><p></p><p>The deities looked at each other, inevitably feeling some trepidation about meeting their "compatriots."</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, they were the "robbers" occupying the bodies of the White Dwarfs. If they were discovered by the relatives and friends of the true selves, they would be done for.</p><p></p><p>The deities discussed it and decided to split into six groups, with each of the six main gods as the leader, exploring in six directions while using the "communication" function to stay in contact and report their situations.</p><p></p><p>Everything proceeded as Suhao had envisioned.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not far from completely deciphering and obtaining the secrets of soul power."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yashan and Fengcheng came to report to Suhao, "Master Wei, you asked us to search for stars within a range of ten thousand light-years. We have completed the search, but did not find any life forms similar to White Dwarfs on other stars."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Good, I understand."</p><p></p><p>The reason he asked Yashan and the others to search other stars was to confirm whether the White Dwarfs on this red giant star were born from this red giant star.</p><p></p><p>Because there was another possibility that the White Dwarfs were born from other stars, then drifted in space to this red giant star, and then proliferated here, just like human "colony stars."</p><p></p><p>Now that he received Yashan's reply, Suhao got the final confirmation: The White Dwarfs were indeed born on this aging star - the red giant star.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Yashan, Fengcheng, I have another task for you. Find all the habitable planets in this star system, then transplant various lifeforms from the Tenth Cross Star onto the habitable planets to transform them into inhabitable planets, and develop them into complete civilizations."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were very interested in this.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Master Wei, are you planning to play a civilization game? Sounds very interesting."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Not quite, it's mainly for conducting some experiments and research, but my plan is not fully formed yet. You'll know in the future."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed, "Don't worry Master Wei, with you saying that, all sorts of novel ideas are popping into my mind. I'll build you all kinds of civilizations, haha!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Oh right, don't link the planets together like the previous Sacred Human Alliance. I want all the planets to remain relatively independent."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng said, "Understood, Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>Suhao was not in a hurry about the planetary civilizations, as that was something needed in the distant future. Moreover, it was not easy for a civilization to form.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing currently was to analyze the method of producing soul power, complete the construction of the soul power spiritual brain, and then successfully package his consciousness information into the soul power spiritual brain.</p><p></p><p>After achieving eternal life, he could do whatever he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Truly unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew rapidly. In less than half a year, the eighteen deities found the "relatively concentrated area" of the White Dwarfs.</p><p></p><p>The reason for adding "relatively" was because the White Dwarf race did not seem to be a communal species, but rather a solitary one. The place the eighteen deities found only had a relatively higher number of White Dwarfs.</p><p></p><p>It could barely be called a gathering place. Suhao marked the task as completed for them.</p><p></p><p>After the eighteen deities completed the task, Suhao gave them the corresponding reward: unlocking the second mini-game...</p><p></p><p>Because he found that the deities really enjoyed playing games.</p><p></p><p>As the deities excitedly cheered, Suhao issued the second task to them through the assistant: Within two years, find a newborn White Dwarf that has not split apart.</p><p></p><p>And the reward for completing the task: Enabling the group chat function for the assistant, rewarding a virtual battle royale.</p><p></p><p>The deities: "???"</p><p></p><p>A newborn White Dwarf?</p><p></p><p>The deities quickly came up with a plan after some discussion: The eighteen deities would act individually while staying in contact at all times.</p><p></p><p>After nearly half a year of adaptation, they had gained a great understanding of the situation on this red giant star. As long as they avoided special areas where the star's energy concentrated and erupted, and did not go too deep into the star's interior, they did not need to worry about other fatal dangers.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, through their observations, they found that the native inhabitants of this star, these smaller White Dwarfs, were completely incapable of normal communication.</p><p></p><p>Nor would they actively attack anything around them.</p><p></p><p>They were like inanimate objects, drifting aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>So the deities did not need to worry about being attacked by any enemies.</p><p></p><p>They tackled the task with great enthusiasm, already qualified as seasoned gamers.</p>

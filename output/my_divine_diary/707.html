        <h1>Chapter 707</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng didn't understand what a [God] was, his eyes full of curiosity. The idea of controlling such a body to travel the world felt very exciting.</p><p></p><p>Yashan had fought against [Gods] countless times before, so he was all too familiar with their power.</p><p></p><p>He had never imagined that after so long, he would be able to see the [God] that had once left him helpless again. Moreover, he would even possess the body of a [God] himself.</p><p></p><p>This was said to be the most sacred and powerful being in the legends of their Zhu Huo people.</p><p></p><p>Yashan couldn't help but step forward and pat the cold, hard pink crystal of the [Eight-Armed God], making a crisp "pa pa" sound like tapping on a dragon's scales.</p><p></p><p>Beautiful, powerful, it stirred one's heart!</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng curiously asked, "Master Wei, how do we control this body? Do we get inside it like driving a car?"</p><p></p><p>"Kaka ka~"</p><p></p><p>The [Eight-Armed God]'s crystal armor surged as Su Hao controlled it, gradually transforming into a humanoid armor form standing upright. "No, what you see now is just the body I'm controlling. My true form is always hidden in the 'second-level space'.</p><p></p><p>In other words, you two will also need to hide your true forms in the second-level space like me, and then control the [God]'s body to move around.</p><p></p><p>As for how to control it, open your assistants and see that last pink vortex icon? That's a new function I added called 'Control Avatar'."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng opened their assistants and saw the corresponding icon.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "After clicking it, your consciousness will enter a small cabin, which you can think of as the [God]'s control room. At that point, your consciousness will temporarily separate from your true form, only maintaining a slight connection. You can use this connection to return to your true form at any time."</p><p></p><p>Yashan's eyes lit up, "Just like a full immersion virtual reality game! So what you're saying is, we'll be playing a special kind of VR game next!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "You could think of it that way. Try it out now - it will take about a day to collect your brain signals for matching. The specific process is to just follow the instructions once inside the cabin."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng eagerly clicked on the pink vortex icon.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the scene around them became illusory, then disappeared, leaving only a vast whiteness.</p><p></p><p>No hearing, no touch, no smell, even their vision was just an illusion created by their brains. The sensation was quite peculiar, as if entering a special dream.</p><p></p><p>They sensed around a bit and discovered a powerful physical form deep in their consciousness - that was their own body that they could return to at any time.</p><p></p><p>Then, a virtual humanoid figure appeared before them, and the assistant's ethereal voice sounded: "Brain signal collection in progress, please follow the simulated figure's movements."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng understood, and began moving along with the virtual figure.</p><p></p><p>For the two celestial cultivators, following even the most complex movements was extremely simple and smooth.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until using various abilities later on that it became difficult.</p><p></p><p>It took a full day of practice before the signal collection finally ended.</p><p></p><p>"Signal matching in progress, please select your [Eight-Armed God]."</p><p></p><p>Then, ninety-five slightly different [Eight-Armed Gods] were listed before them, numbered one to ninety-five.</p><p></p><p>Yashan chose number two without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>Then, the number two [Eight-Armed God] disappeared from Feng Cheng's view. Not thinking much of it, Feng Cheng chose number three.</p><p></p><p>"Matching in progress, please wait."</p><p></p><p>"Match successful."</p><p></p><p>After the prompt sounded, a button with four words appeared in both their fields of vision: "Log into Avatar".</p><p></p><p>What else could they do? They clicked the button to log in without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Ka~"</p><p></p><p>With a sound like the world shattering, the vast whiteness suddenly broke apart and fell into darkness.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the number two and number three [Eight-Armed Gods] opened their eyes, greeted by the familiar scene of the warehouse displaying the [Eight-Armed Gods].</p><p></p><p>"Is that it?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng's consciousnesses had successfully taken control of the [Eight-Armed Gods].</p><p></p><p>The two first spent some time experiencing the sensations their new [God] bodies provided, getting used to it. After a while, they tried walking forward, feeling quite clumsy at first. But after a few steps, they had mostly adapted to these new bodies and walked out of the compartment storing them.</p><p></p><p>Going from a human body to the form of a [God] walking on all fours was quite a novel experience.</p><p></p><p>After coming out, Yashan and Feng Cheng looked each other over, having to admit the [Eight-Armed Gods] looked incredibly cool no matter how you viewed them!</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng wondered, "Where is my true form? I can only sense its existence but not its location."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "But I feel like with just a thought, I can return to it at any time."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng tried it out for a while and found he could quickly use the abilities from the [Fate] sequence, but struggled with using abilities from other sequences, feeling very unfamiliar with them.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask, "Elder Yashan, I saw Master Wei could directly transform the [God] into a human form. How do we do that? I tried but couldn't figure out how..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan tried as well, only able to construct a humanoid shape with the crystal armor at most, but still fundamentally not a human body.</p><p></p><p>He said uncertainly, "Maybe it uses abilities from the other sequences? I'm not too familiar with those either...No need to rush, we can slowly try out all the other sequence abilities one by one and we're bound to find the corresponding method. Plus, the assistant has introductions to the other sequence abilities, we can study those later."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "The [Fate] sequence abilities are still the most familiar to use."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were trying out the various abilities of the [Eight-Armed Gods] in this small world, Su Hao flashed into appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "How does it feel?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan waved his tentacles around and clenched a paw, "It feels great, like this is my own body. I can't detect any abnormalities at all."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also said, "I almost thought I had switched bodies again. It's truly incredible when you think about it!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "I'm still not too familiar with the [God]'s abilities yet, so I can't fully unleash its power for now. I can only use the abilities I'm used to like [Fate], spiritual energy, blood energy and runes. Using abilities from the other sequences still feels a bit unnatural."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "That's normal, it's like asking a guitarist to play the piano. Even though they're both musicians, the instruments they're used to are different.</p><p></p><p>But you at least have some basics. With dedicated practice over some time, you'll quickly master everything.</p><p></p><p>Oh right, you two should stay here for now. Once you can transform into a human form, then you can go out! Otherwise I'm afraid you'll scare people if they see you."</p><p></p><p>If they walked around in [Eight-Armed God] form, they'd most likely be mistaken for an alien invasion!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "This is the ability from the [Mimic Human] sequence. Just keep practicing and you'll get it soon. All the abilities are imprinted as instincts in the [God]'s body. The reason you can't use them is because these aren't abilities from your true forms, so your brain signals haven't fully matched with the [God] yet. You just need dedicated training, probably around a month should do it."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Then Yashan curiously asked, "Master Wei, are our true forms also hidden away like yours?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Correct, all our true forms need to be concealed in the 'second-level space' to ensure absolute safety.</p><p></p><p>But you two haven't learned the 'second-level space' yet, so I'm temporarily hiding them for you for now.</p><p></p><p>However, it's too inconvenient for me to keep helping out like this. I'll come up with a way later for you to seal yourselves in the 'second-level space'."</p><p></p><p>The two lowered their heads in embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment and said, "For now, you should focus on getting used to controlling the [Eight-Armed Gods]. Next, I have a task for you: analyze this world's life support pods, and then work with the 'source materials' to create life support pods suitable for our three true forms to use for extended periods.</p><p></p><p>Hmm...aim for at least a few hundred years without needing to leave the second-level space, the longer the better. If you can make pods that last 10,000 years, even better."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng: "Understood, Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan realized this made sense. As celestial cultivators, their physical bodies could indeed last a very long time without food, but that didn't mean they never needed nourishment at all.</p><p></p><p>They still needed to replenish nutrients periodically.</p><p></p><p>So if they wanted to move around completely in [God] form, these life support pods became absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>As for why Master Wei wanted to hide all three of their true forms, Yashan understood: "In the previous life, we inexplicably encountered a 'cosmic high-energy particle flow', and as powerful as Feng Cheng and I were, we died instantly without any chance to react.</p><p></p><p>Master Wei is avoiding such sudden dangers by hiding our true forms away and using the [Gods] as proxies.</p><p></p><p>As expected of Master Wei, truly the most invincible existence in the universe. He even thought of hiding our true forms to avoid all kinds of dangers.</p><p></p><p>This way, even if we're too reckless and our bodies get damaged, it doesn't matter - we can just get a new one.</p><p></p><p>There are so many mature [Gods] in the warehouse, we can make more whenever we want!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yashan got excited, like...he could do whatever he wanted now!</p><p></p><p>As he pondered further, he shook his head, "No no! How can I recklessly use the body Master Wei created for me? I should cherish it! Unless..."</p><p></p><p>"Unless Master Wei tells me to go wild!"</p>

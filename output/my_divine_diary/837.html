        <h1>Chapter 837</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After making an agreement with the God of Suppressing Heaven - Natida, Su Hao sent Natida's various servants to it at the fastest speed, and then began to study Natida's main body.</p><p></p><p>His research direction was very clear, divided into several steps:</p><p></p><p>Second, why the Ten-Colored Plate could carry consciousness, and how it differed from his spiritual brain;</p><p></p><p>Third, what was the essential structure of the so-called soul power, soul arts, and soul seeds, and how they functioned; </p><p></p><p>Fourth, how the gods' skills of occupying physical bodies, soul-searching techniques, and separating avatar bodies were achieved;</p><p></p><p>If he could solve all these problems one by one, it would be equivalent to thoroughly studying this so-called Ten-Colored Plate.</p><p></p><p>However, this needed to be done step-by-step. The main body of the God of Suppressing Heaven - Natida was under his control, so he could do whatever he wanted with it, no need to rush.</p><p></p><p>While observing the material of the Ten-Colored Plate, Su Hao chatted idly with Natida: "Natida, how old are you?"</p><p></p><p>Natida shook his head: "I've long forgotten. Originally I kept records, but suddenly one year I stopped recording, and after that I completely forgot my age. Moreover, for us gods, it has no meaning."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao considered it from another perspective, it was indeed so. When time no longer had value, who would care about time? Wasn't it because time was limited that people said time was precious?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps after Su Hao truly gained eternal life, he would no longer care about time either!</p><p></p><p>Natida seemed unwilling to bring up the past: "This is my secret, it's not important for you."</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao shook his head: "You're wrong, Natida. Obtaining complete information is very important for my research. Your answer can help me grasp the secrets of the Ten-Colored Plate more quickly."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao's burning yet icy gaze, Natida had no choice but to sink into his deep-buried memories. After a long time, he said: "The Ten-Colored Plate was not originally called the Ten-Colored Plate, nor was it called divine light. These are just names we gods came up with to forget the past. In fact, they have their own name, called Bai Jia'er.</p><p></p><p>All the divine lights of the gods were transformed by occupying the bodies of Bai Jia'er after they shed their old forms, belonging to the same race.</p><p></p><p>Bai Jia'er did not originate from this planet, but came from the distant universe. This is what Bai Jia'er told me himself when we were still very good friends."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao marveled: "Good friends from the distant universe? It sounds very fantastical."</p><p></p><p>Natida nodded: "That's right, Bai Jia'er's homeland is not here. As for where exactly, I can't say clearly either. I tried to search for it for over a thousand years but found nothing, so I gave up and returned to this Ten-Cross Planet.</p><p></p><p>Oh, this main body of mine was originally a Bai Jia'er too. He had his own name, called Qiu...</p><p></p><p>This is a secret I've buried for countless years, which should have been forever concealed and unknown to anyone. But since you want to know, I'll tell you. What has happened in the past no longer matters."</p><p></p><p>Natida fell silent for a moment, as if organizing his words or sinking into memories: "I had two older brothers and one older sister. We four children were born one after another, and I was the youngest. The food our parents brought back was always snatched away by my older brothers and sisters, leaving me with only a tiny portion.</p><p></p><p>So I grew very slowly and was very weak, not only physically weak but also timid in character, and I was often the one being bullied.</p><p></p><p>One day, when our parents went out hunting, I was bullied by my older brothers and sisters and accidentally fell out of the nest and down a cliff. It just so happened to be after a rainstorm, and a rapid river had formed below. I narrowly escaped death and was washed away by the river currents...</p><p></p><p>From a very young age, I faced this cruel world alone. Once when hunting a wild boar, I was instead gored by it and nearly died. It was Qiu who saved me. Without Qiu, I would have died very early on.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Qiu was my god. He saved my life and taught me powerful soul arts, allowing me to grow up smoothly...</p><p></p><p>Qiu and I became good friends. Qiu told me everything about himself.</p><p></p><p>He came from a beautiful planet in the universe. He said he had traveled across countless distances to come here, searching for his child. He sensed that his child was enduring extreme suffering, so he came here to rescue his child..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Natida paused.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked in astonishment: "Can Bai Jia'er sense each other from such vast distances?"</p><p></p><p>Natida said: "Bai Jia'er can split from each other, and also merge back together. The split-off sub-bodies are their children. There is a kind of inexplicable emotional resonance between them, no matter how far apart they are. Of course, if they wish, this resonance can be shielded."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "Continue, what happened next? Did you kill your friend?"</p><p></p><p>Natida nodded, his expression becoming extremely pained, as if seeking some kind of affirmation and redemption: "Qiu gave me great power, and I helped him rescue his child. We were the best of friends and cooperated with each other...</p><p></p><p>In the process of helping Qiu rescue his child, I gradually understood everything:</p><p></p><p>But I was different from them. Those powerful people imprisoned the Bai Jia'er, rudely snatching the Bai Jia'er's power, and even directly plundered their bodies.</p><p></p><p>As for me, I was no match for those people at all. Their power was too great, and I was completely unable to help Qiu rescue his child.</p><p></p><p>I hated those who imprisoned and plundered the Bai Jia'er's bodies, no matter how powerful they were.</p><p></p><p>And then..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stroked his chin and continued for him: "And then you couldn't resist the craving for power and plundered Qiu's body? Tsk tsk tsk, Natida, you really are an extremely vile fellow."</p><p></p><p>Natida sighed: "At first I just wanted to gain more power to help Qiu rescue his child. I didn't expect it to develop like this. This wasn't the result I wanted, but everything is irreversible now."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked curiously: "At that time, you were just an ordinary Golden Dragon bestowed with soul power by Bai Jia'er. In theory, you were no match for Bai Jia'er, so how could you possibly succeed in plundering his body? It seems almost impossible."</p><p></p><p>Natida overcame the struggles in his heart and told Su Hao the truth: "This has to do with the Bai Jia'er's character. They are too kind, kind to an incomprehensible degree. They have an unimaginable love for this world, for this universe. They cannot bear to destroy anything they see. They have ultimate goodwill towards every tree, every blade of grass, every insect...</p><p></p><p>Including me, who was treated so cruelly. Even if Qiu knew I had plundered his body, he wouldn't have the slightest thought of harming me. He would only tell me the pain of having his body plundered, but would never think of hurting me.</p><p></p><p>And this is also the reason why I could succeed, and why other gods could succeed in plundering the Bai Jia'er's bodies. For a period after I first plundered Qiu's body, as long as Qiu was willing, he could break free from my imprisonment at any time. But he didn't do that, because he was worried about harming me. He only told me his pain..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was astonished and couldn't help exclaiming: "That's outrageous."</p><p></p><p>Natida said: "Yes, the kindness of the Bai Jia'er is something I cannot comprehend... It was precisely because he couldn't bear to harm anything that he sought my help, hoping I could rescue his child. But the me that Qiu found not only failed to help him, but also plunged him into suffering."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked again: "What happened next? After plundering his body, did you succeed in rescuing Qiu's child?"</p><p></p><p>Natida shook his head: "No, I tried, but the one who plundered Qiu's child was the Black Dragon God of Myriad Thunders - Gu. He also possessed great power, and I was powerless against him. Later, Qiu's father sensed Qiu's suffering and also came to the Ten-Cross Planet..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao suddenly realized something and stared wide-eyed in disbelief: "Then Qiu's father, in order to rescue Qiu, also crossed the vast distance to come to the Ten-Cross Planet, and then had his body plundered too?"</p><p></p><p>Natida nodded: "Qiu's father is now the Human God of Salvation - Baishen. Then Qiu's father's father - Qiu's grandfather also came and became the Mountain Spirit God of the Land - Weila. Soon after, Qiu's great-grandfather came...</p><p></p><p>Until some gods created the ability to shield the Bai Jia'er's emotional resonance, no new Bai Jia'er from the universe sensed their relatives' suffering and came to the Ten-Cross Planet. It was also around that time that we gods made the 'Covenant of No New Gods Being Born in This World'."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help cursing: "F**k, you gods did such a f**ked up thing, actually taking down Bai Jia'er's entire family."</p><p></p><p>After saying it out loud, Natida seemed to have gained self-redemption and didn't care much about Su Hao's curses.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao seemed to think of something and asked curiously: "Is Qiu still alive?"</p><p></p><p>Natida nodded: "Qiu is still alive, but I have imprisoned and shielded him. I cannot completely erase Qiu's will, because Qiu's will is fused with the divine light. Forcibly erasing it would cause the entire Bai Jia'er body to collapse.</p><p></p><p>So, every moment I'm alive, I can feel Qiu's agonized wails of suffering. He tells me he is in pain. My soul is constantly bearing remorse and self-condemnation. My suffering is no less than Qiu's. But I have no choice!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed out the core issue: "Since you are remorseful and suffering, why don't you separate from Qiu and give him back his freedom?"</p><p></p><p>Natida immediately refused: "No way, if I separate from Qiu, I will no longer be a god. I will lose everything... The current situation is quite good actually."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at the brilliantly colored, flowing Ten-Colored Plate before him and mocked: "Is this you seeking self-redemption? You got the benefits but still want to act innocent. Natida, you really are shameless."</p><p></p><p>The kind suffer eternal oppression, while the evil enjoy eternal life and freedom.</p><p></p><p>Who dares to be kind, if this is how it is?</p><p></p><p>It is all like this!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao felt great disdain for the gods' actions. Plundering others' bodies for eternal life was understandable - after all, who could resist such temptation? He would be more eager for it than anyone.</p><p></p><p>But their attitude of having gained eternal life yet still pretending they didn't want it this way and that they too were suffering - this was something he found utterly contemptible.</p>

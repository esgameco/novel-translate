        <h1>Chapter 650</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Regarding the realms beyond the 'Hua Shen Realm', it was not that Su Hao did not bring Ya Shan along, but rather Ya Shan had his own independent research project.</p><p></p><p>That was the calculation and research on 'Source Materials'.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Su Hao had already transformed most elements and common compounds, but this did not mean it was over. There were still more complex substances that needed to be calculated and then synthesized.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's job was to transform one by one all the materials used in daily life and experiments.</p><p></p><p>This task was extremely difficult, but with Su Hao's previous extensive experiments as reference, after a period of study, Ya Shan was able to manifest the experimental process. It just required a large amount of time.</p><p></p><p>This was not a big problem, as they now had plenty of time.</p><p></p><p>The only difficulty was that calculating the data for various substances and transforming them required the use of specific 'small worlds' as aids, and Ya Shan had not learned how to use small worlds...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly came up with a solution - he would first create a large number of stable small worlds, seal them in metal balls of various models, and teach Ya Shan how to use the 'small world' metal balls!</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan stayed in his own lab, frequently gazing at Su Hao's lab with longing eyes.</p><p></p><p>Compared to researching one project alone, he preferred studying the same project together with Master Su...</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan clenched his fists secretly to motivate himself: "I still need to study harder, truly catch up to Master Su's pace! First become proficient with 'small world balls', strive to fully master their usage within a year, then within five years repeat all the 'source material' experiments Master Su has done, within ten years complete all the compounds used, within thirty years synthesize delicious food..."</p><p></p><p>As for Feng Cheng...</p><p></p><p>He was still in the learning stage, able to cast some relatively advanced 'miscellaneous' spells!</p><p></p><p>This was mainly because Feng Cheng was a native of the cultivation world, immersed in it from a young age, so the rigorous 'scientific view' had not yet been reversed, and his thinking was more inclined towards 'cultivation-becoming stronger-success'.</p><p></p><p>To have the current level of understanding and ability was already extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Lab No. 1, after listening to Fei Yao's exposition on cultivation, Su Hao checked his current cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>Then he said, "Fei Yao, you have now reached the qualifications to break through the 'Hua Shen Realm'. The next step is to build your own 'Identification Platform' to store part of your consciousness information, further enhancing your perceptual abilities and consciousness strength.</p><p></p><p>I have a method called 'Triangular Printing' that can allow you to successfully build the Identification Platform and reach the Hua Shen Realm without too much thought, step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>But I still hope you don't rush, but first settle down and learn from me for a period of time. Fully comprehend the structure and building concepts of the 'Identification Platform', and then use your own methods to build your own 'Identification Platform'. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao said, "If Mr. Jia Wei is willing to teach me, that would be best."</p><p></p><p>Then he said what he had been preparing for a long time: "Moreover, my current everything is given by Mr. Jia Wei. From now on, I will listen to Mr. Jia Wei's arrangements. If there is any use for me, I will do my utmost."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Then let's do that!"</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Hao personally explained to Fei Yao the 'outline' of cultivation, the ultimate goal of cultivation, the role of 'spiritual sense', the ideas and structure behind the 'Identification Platform', etc.</p><p></p><p>Without any reservation, he slowly explained it all to Fei Yao.</p><p></p><p>All along, the role Su Hao played more often was that of a student, being a student far more times than being a teacher.</p><p></p><p>But that did not mean Su Hao could not teach students. He had his own methods for teaching, which were far superior to those "can only be comprehended, not explained" cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Plus, Fei Yao himself was also very capable. Su Hao's explanations progressed very quickly.</p><p></p><p>In less than two years, Fei Yao had successfully broken through to the 'Hua Shen Realm' through his own efforts.</p><p></p><p>The method he used was not the same as others using 'Triangular Printing', but rather referring to Su Hao's ideas, he built an 'Orbit Superposition' structure himself to directly generate 'unit blocks' and break through the 'Hua Shen Realm'. The speed was not slower than 'Triangular Printing'.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, after these two years of research, Fei Yao's understanding of cultivation was even higher than Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's.</p><p></p><p>After Fei Yao successfully broke through to the Hua Shen Realm, Su Hao smiled and asked, "How does it feel?"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao's perceptual range reached 30,000 meters, able to encompass the entire spaceship.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes, experiencing the novel sensation of being 'everywhere', murmuring, "So this is 'spiritual sense'? Too wondrous! It's as if there are countless versions of me, observing this huge spaceship from different angles, with not a single detail escaping my eyes."</p><p></p><p>Then he saw Yuan Feng and Ling Xue secretly dating in a corner of the ship, and his eyes opened involuntarily from the scorching sight...</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao carefully experienced it again, then suddenly asked, "Mr. Jia Wei, what do you think 'spiritual power' is?"</p><p></p><p>He originally thought Su Hao would know the answer, but unexpectedly Su Hao shook his head, "I don't know what spiritual power is."</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao was astonished, "You don't know either?"</p><p></p><p>He did not doubt at all that Mr. Jia Wei was holding anything back. Over so many years of contact, he received very serious and meticulous answers to any question he asked.</p><p></p><p>He understood that Su Hao would not lie, or rather, Su Hao disdained lying.</p><p></p><p>These areas of knowledge did not seem to be any big secret in Mr. Jia Wei's eyes...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and said, "There are still many things I don't know, it's not strange at all. However, I have my own views on spiritual power. If you're interested, I can share them, but they may not necessarily be correct."</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao became serious.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "In my view, 'spiritual power' encompasses many forms, but regardless of the form, it has one important function - the bridge connecting 'consciousness' and the 'environment'."</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao grasped the subject, object and verb, quickly absorbing the meaning Su Hao expressed: spiritual power is a 'bridge'!</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao pondered, and spiritual power did indeed have this characteristic. Categorizing it this way was actually not wrong, but rather very precise.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "So, what is spiritual power? Things like 'vision', 'hearing', 'smell', 'touch', etc., I classify them all as special functions of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>And controlling the grasping of hands, the walking of feet, jumping and so on, I also categorize as another type of spiritual power. This kind of spiritual power can most directly allow our consciousness to transform the world.</p><p></p><p>This is a function that humans are born with. In other words, this is a spiritual power that a normal person is born with.</p><p></p><p>Of course, I know most people's understanding of spiritual power is not like this, but rather referring to that mysterious consciousness power with profound functions.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how profound, the essence is the same - simply described as the 'interactive ability between consciousness and the external world'."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Fei Yao couldn't help but nod in agreement. He also highly approved of Mr. Jia Wei's categorization of spiritual power from this never-before-considered angle.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "After simply defining spiritual power, the subsequent analysis becomes very clear.</p><p></p><p>Take the spiritual power of the Source Masters - its essence is the 'consciousness' tool to influence the 'Source'. Those with spiritual talents can 'see' the Source and influence it, just like our eyes see the world and our hands do labor.</p><p></p><p>The 'spiritual sense' in cultivation is also essentially a consciousness tool. 'Spiritual sense' allows you to view the surrounding environment from another perspective, and also control 'spiritual power' to change the world..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao gave many more examples, explaining one by one his views on spiritual power. Finally, he concluded, "So in my view, spiritual power has two functions of consciousness - one is 'eyes', the other is 'hands'.</p><p></p><p>What we often say about cultivating spiritual power, enhancing spiritual power, is actually strengthening our ability to observe the world and transform the world."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Fei Yao suddenly understood what Su Hao meant earlier by the project 'Beyond Hua Shen'.</p><p></p><p>He blurted out, "Mr. Jia Wei, you invited me to participate in the 'Beyond Hua Shen' research project with the aim of obtaining even stronger 'eyes' and 'hands', right?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Correct. Our spiritual power now is very strong, allowing us to observe a vast range. But in the face of the vast universe, it is still too small. I need stronger observational and transformative abilities to let me see more things I cannot see now!"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao said, "I understand! 'Beyond Hua Shen' will be my next goal!"</p>

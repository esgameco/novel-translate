        <h1>Chapter 948</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After dealing with the matter of Counsellor Cao, Su Hao directly stretched out his hands and drew upon a large amount of source energy, beginning to transform it into pure spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>A white light gradually appeared in front of his palms, growing brighter and brighter. A tremendous fluctuation of spiritual power radiated outwards in all directions. </p><p></p><p>Finally, after expanding to a diameter of several hundred meters, it gradually came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the Eighteen Deities gaping in astonishment. They had previously used White Galactic bodies, so they knew this was spiritual power, but they had never seen a spiritual power mass with a diameter of several hundred meters before. Even if you piled up over a thousand White Galactic beings, their combined mass probably wouldn't be this large.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually waved his hand, and the giant spiritual power mass immediately split into eighteen portions, floating above each of their heads.</p><p></p><p>The deities couldn't help but open their mouths wide and look up.</p><p></p><p>"What is Jia Wei trying to do? Where did he get so much spiritual power from? It's unthinkable."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed to the massive spiritual power masses above and smiled, "The spiritual power masses above are extremely pure, without any contamination from conscious information. Each of you gets one portion."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi asked, "Is this...for creating a fixed spiritual network structure for us?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Correct. Today I am officially assigning you all a long-term mission. The first stage is to produce at least one thousand spiritual power devices. The specific structures have been sent to your assistants.</p><p></p><p>Rest assured, these devices are different from the main units of the Cruciform Stars. They are very simple receiving and relaying sub-units, not difficult to produce. And the spiritual power mass above is enough for each of you to make at least one hundred of these sub-units."</p><p></p><p>The deities immediately opened their assistants to check, and indeed as Su Hao said, the difficulty was not high, letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu asked, "Sir Jia Wei, has your Infinite Lands plan begun?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Indeed it has! Starting from the Cruciform Stars and a few hundred trial stars first. If you're interested, you can go observe the construction sites."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Dual Sword City, on the massive square, groups of a hundred people formed formations, with several hundred such formations lined up in neat rows.</p><p></p><p>Nearly fifty thousand people were silent at this moment, as if waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling stood on the high platform, checking over the 'World Passage' construction plan one more time, surveying the more than three hundred disciples present.</p><p></p><p>These more than three hundred disciples were the highest cultivators among those present, and would serve as squad leaders for this project, responsible for leading their own hundred-person teams to complete the corresponding tasks of opening and stabilizing the passage between the two worlds.</p><p></p><p>Years of preparation had gone into training this nearly fifty thousand person construction crew, all for this moment.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling looked sternly at the more than three hundred disciples and said solemnly, "Fellow disciples of Dual Sword Sect, our master has prepared for this project for two hundred years, and we have worked hard for two hundred years for this very moment. Now that we are truly about to begin, we must not let carelessness leave any hidden dangers in the project. Every single detail must be implemented according to the requirements. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>The more than three hundred disciples answered in unison, "This disciple understands, please rest assured, Senior Martial Sister."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling nodded slightly, and continued, "Not only is our master watching over this, but our two senior martial uncles are also observing. We must show our absolute best, and must not let Dual Sword Sect lose face."</p><p></p><p>"Now, according to your preset tasks, set out!"</p><p></p><p>The three hundred disciples answered in affirmation.</p><p></p><p>They then flashed to the front of their respective teams and began issuing corresponding orders.</p><p></p><p>The nearly fifty thousand disciples were seen transmitting away one after another. Soon, the entire square was left with only Cong Shuling remaining.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling took a deep breath and reported the situation to Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the disciples of the Infinite Sect also received orders from the Elf King Vari and transmitted to their respective task locations, beginning their missions.</p><p></p><p>A massive world passage remodeling operation had now begun, expected to last for a hundred years before it would finally come to a halt.</p><p></p><p>On a trial star, a tall blue-skinned giant demon was entering a luxurious palace amidst a series of reports.</p><p></p><p>He knelt down and reported loudly, "Reporting to the Eternal Demon God King, my subordinates discovered a group of creatures with unknown origins and bizarre appearances resembling the 'trial takers' humans you described, numbering around a hundred, recklessly destroying the structures of my Ataris Mountain Range. They have crudely excavated a chasm of unfathomable depth along the mountain ridge, as if a divine sword had split it open.</p><p></p><p>Those humans possess incomparably powerful strength. The soldiers I sent to investigate were ruthlessly driven away, unable to approach even slightly.</p><p></p><p>So I personally brought the 'celestial eye camera' you bestowed and recorded their actions."</p><p></p><p>He then took out a camera and held it up.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King seated above was the great demon king of this trial star. He had followed Yashan's teachings for a hundred years, but was too unrighteous in nature and was ultimately rejected by Yashan and sent back to his home planet to continue being the Demon God King.</p><p></p><p>Many years had passed, and he had grown quite comfortable, easily dealing with any traversers who came for trials.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing his subordinate's report, he was stunned. He waved away the five or six slender female demon attendants and immediately beckoned for the camera.</p><p></p><p>The camera flew up, and he grasped it in his hand, quickly playing back the recording.</p><p></p><p>The image showed a group of cultivators in mid-air, madly attacking the mountain range, forcibly blasting out a deep trench along the ridge that extended into the distance. The excavated dirt and rocks were being neatly piled up to one side, growing taller and taller.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King's expression changed as he watched, secretly shocked. "Are these humans? Are they trial takers? It doesn't seem so - trial takers wouldn't have such tremendous destructive power. Then who are these humans? Could they have been sent by my teacher?"</p><p></p><p>His expression regained its calm as his thoughts raced. "No, I need to go investigate this myself. If these humans have malicious intentions, I cannot just watch them destroy the world I reside in. No matter what, this is still my territory. Even if there are reasons behind it, they are working and wantonly destroying things in my territory without my permission."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, the towering Demon God King suddenly stood up and roared, "Summon the troops! The Demon God Clan Guards, assemble at once! You will follow me into battle."</p><p></p><p>The Demon God Clan Guards were an elite force he had cultivated for self-protection after discovering he had become a trial demon king. With a total of two thousand demon warriors, each brimming with demonic power that was not much weaker than those of the trial takers.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King led his troops and soon arrived at the Ataris Mountain Range, witnessing the humans fervently working on the project.</p><p></p><p>He thought quickly, "Though these humans' strength is slightly inferior to mine, it is far greater than I initially imagined. Their identities and origins must be extraordinary. I need to be very careful."</p><p></p><p>Ever since Yashan took him away for a hundred years, he realized the mysteries of this starry realm were not as simple as he had seen or imagined.</p><p></p><p>With that, he ordered, "Boga Mackenzie, take the first squad to probe forward and inquire about their purpose. Pay attention - since the situation is unclear, do not engage in combat recklessly."</p><p></p><p>A towering, formidable demon immediately stepped forward from behind, saluted and said, "Yes, great king."</p><p></p><p>He then led a hundred soldiers out, flying towards the distant mountain range.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Boga Mackenzie returned with a battered group of soldiers.</p><p></p><p>He knelt down, dejected. "Reporting to the great king, I was incompetent and unable to gather any useful intelligence. As soon as we approached, they drove us away without a second word. We are no match for them."</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King's expression fluctuated as he looked behind him. There were nearly two thousand troops remaining, while the other side only had a hundred people. Two thousand against one hundred, it was assured.</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned grim, and he waved his demon staff forward, "All Demon Clan Guards, attack on my command!"</p><p></p><p>All the guards immediately charged forward.</p><p></p><p>A strange rippling wave expanded outwards, and any guards caught in it immediately dropped from mid-air like dumplings, hitting the ground with a series of dull thumps.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King was stunned. "What??"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, a young man in a long robe suddenly appeared before him, smiling, "So you're the Demon God King! Don't you remember me? I did take a crystal ball from you back then."</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King was shaken, as scenes from the past replayed in his mind. He was overwhelmed with shock, "It's you, the brat who called himself Lan Zhichang."</p><p></p><p>Lan Zhichang smiled, "Good memory. I still haven't thanked you for going easy on me back then, which allowed me to gain a great teacher and cultivate to my current state. I don't know how to repay you now."</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King heard the obvious sarcasm, as he had indeed tried to kill Lan Zhichang's group back then. But he didn't immediately retaliate, instead asking, "Just what is going on with you trial takers?"</p><p></p><p>Lan Zhichang spread his hands, "Sorry, but I can't tell you that. It seems you're very curious about what we're doing, but this is not something you can get involved in. To prevent you from randomly interfering with our project, I ask that Your Majesty wait here obediently and not wander around recklessly. After all, you do possess some ability."</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King laughed loudly upon hearing this, "Just relying on a puny trial taker like you? It's been four hundred years since we last met - do you think I'm still the same as before? You have no idea about my current strength. If you're capable, then come at me!"</p><p></p><p>Lan Zhichang stretched out his hand towards the Demon God King and grasped, "Spatial Prison."</p><p></p><p>He then turned and left nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King had all his defenses up, but the expected attack never came.</p><p></p><p>Puzzled, he soon realized something was off. All sounds around him had disappeared. He reached out and felt a soft, cotton-like barrier.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>This was the dimension-reducing strike of knowledge.</p>

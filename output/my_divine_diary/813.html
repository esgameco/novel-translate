        <h1>Chapter 813</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>To the southeast of the Heavenly Prairie, there was an enormous basin called the Land of Gold.</p><p></p><p>Countless humans, dragons, and mountain spirits harboring dreams of striking it rich gathered here, jointly mining the ownerless gold deposits.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with different races congregating in one place, some friction was inevitable, so every day there would be some bloody disappearance incidents in this Land of Gold.</p><p></p><p>This was very normal.</p><p></p><p>For in the eyes of these gold prospectors, without gold, what was the point of living?</p><p></p><p>In one corner of the Land of Gold was a small town called 'Gold Mining Town'.</p><p></p><p>Inside the town was a lively tavern teeming with many tall, burly humans as well as quite a few charming, slender women, drinking and chatting loudly.</p><p></p><p>These people were dressed extremely wildly and roughly, carrying all kinds of weapons, wearing simple vests that exposed their tremendously muscular builds, looking quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>Almost all of them were gold prospectors who had come here to strike gold, though 'plunderer' was also everyone's hidden profession, or side gig you could say.</p><p></p><p>In the tavern, a long-haired green-eyed man was drinking and pounding the table, boasting about all sorts of exaggerated exploits, looking ready to pick a fight with anyone at any moment.</p><p></p><p>After downing a huge mug of beer, he pulled a charming young lady close as if to say something, but suddenly froze, reached out and firmly grabbed her perky bottom, then took out a handful of gold beans from his pocket and stuffed them into the lady's cleavage, laughing loudly, "My darling, I'll be out for a bit, you'd better wait for me to come back!"</p><p></p><p>With the lady giving him a reluctant look, he strode out of the tavern. Soon he arrived at a small grassy knoll next to the town.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a faint golden light gradually coalesced, forming a glowing orb the size of a coconut that flowed and changed shape fluidly like water.</p><p></p><p>The orb stabilized in the long-haired golden man's hand, and then a strange humming sound came from it, "Respected Lord Bari, your servant Bode has encountered an extremely powerful enemy and unfortunately perished in battle. The mission you entrusted to me has not been completed. I hereby request Lord Bari's forgiveness."</p><p></p><p>The long-haired golden man, who was none other than the God of Gold Bari, said in surprise, "Bode, with your strength, unless you encountered another deity, you should have been able to escape safely. How could you be directly killed?"</p><p></p><p>The key was, if he had encountered another deity, Bode's will would have been directly shattered, with no chance to escape back.</p><p></p><p>After Bode the divine messenger briefly explained the situation, he said regretfully, "Respected Lord Bari, I was just about to charge into the dragon's lair when I died for no apparent reason, and did not see who the enemy was."</p><p></p><p>The God of Gold Bari raised an eyebrow and lightly tapped Bode's will with his finger, immediately projecting a scene that appeared to be what Bode saw flying over the sea - a red-golden dragon spreading its wings to take flight, and three dragon hatchlings, with nothing else in sight.</p><p></p><p>After examining it for a moment without finding any clues, he said with interest, "It seems an old friend is hiding here! Let me guess who it could be? This is quite an interesting game, haha!"</p><p></p><p>He slowly clenched his fist, absorbing the golden light orb in his palm. "Let me find you a suitable vessel first! Then come with me to see just who it is. Do you have anyone in mind, Bode?"</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger Bode's voice came, "Thank you for your kindness, Lord Bari. There is a suitable candidate - the 7th rank soul cultivator Orange Reo is seeking a way to become a divine messenger, just as she wishes."</p><p></p><p>The God of Gold Bari had no objections. Suddenly thinking of something, he asked, "Bode, did you leave a tracking mark?"</p><p></p><p>Bode replied, "I left a mark on that red-golden dragon, so I can track her location."</p><p></p><p>Bari smiled contentedly, "Excellent. Hopefully this can add some fun to my boring life."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over the boundless ocean, the dragon mother Shadow was rapidly flying while carrying her three hatchlings.</p><p></p><p>The actual speed was very fast, but over the vast sea it seemed excruciatingly slow.</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually asked, "Dragon Mother Shadow, where are we going? To a new dwelling?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mother Shadow said, "Yes children, I'm taking you to find our next home. However, we can no longer stay in the Heavenly Prairie, as although the food is abundant there, it's far too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>In just over two months, we first encountered the human 'dragon hunters', then a human divine messenger. Each time was extremely perilous - if not for Leian's exceptional abilities, our situation would have been dire indeed.</p><p></p><p>And children, for you to grow strong enough to fend for yourselves will take at least fifty years. I can't imagine surviving at this pace for that long."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said a bit awkwardly, "Dragon Mother Shadow, perhaps it was just an accident. If we wait another month it should be fine, no need to worry so much."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mother Shadow shook her head, "My child, remember - if there are too many 'accidents', then they are no longer accidents."</p><p></p><p>Suhao suggested, "Where is Dragon Isle? We have nowhere better to go now, why don't we return to Dragon Isle? I'm very curious about soul power and eager to awaken it as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mother Shadow said, "This time, I plan to take you back to Dragon Isle to find your father Muti. Raising you three children alone, I've felt some strain. Perhaps I'm not a good mother, putting you in danger so many times."</p><p></p><p>Suhao's eyes lit up, "We're really going back to Dragon Isle? Wonderful, I'm full of anticipation!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mother Shadow said, "Dragon Isle is extremely far from here, across the Endless Sea. With my strength, I cannot possibly cross the ocean to return to Dragon Isle directly.</p><p></p><p>To get back to Dragon Isle, we need to fly northwest, taking a long detour. It will take two months, as in that direction there are many large and small islands lined up one after another, allowing me to stop and rest on an island every two days of flight."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said in surprise, "The islands are lined up all the way to Dragon Isle? What an unusual geographical formation."</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother continued, "This chain of islands can be considered the only passage between Dragon Isle and the Heavenly Prairie, called the 'Heavenly Channel'. This channel is packed with vicious pirates specializing in hunting and plundering passersby - extremely dangerous. These pirates include humans, mountain spirits, and even dragons - anything of value is their prey.</p><p></p><p>Even as a mature golden dragon, traveling alone I would face threats from these pirates.</p><p></p><p>Originally I planned to wait until you grew up and learned to fly before taking you back to Dragon Isle via these islands.</p><p></p><p>But since we've provoked a human divine messenger in the Heavenly Prairie, we have to take this risk earlier. However..."</p><p></p><p>Here Dragon Mother Shadow paused, then continued, "However, my decision to take you back early was made after deep consideration. Previously I had major doubts - first about safety, second about obtaining enough food for your growth.</p><p></p><p>Now I'm much more at ease, because with my protection combined with your awakened abilities Leian, we should be able to travel smoothly and obtain ample food."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mother Shadow rambled on, not caring whether the three hatchlings understood or not. Perhaps she was speaking to Suhao, or perhaps to herself.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Dragon Mother Shadow, rest assured. With my pinpoint accuracy abilities, there won't be any major issues. Let's return to Dragon Isle quickly so you can teach me soul arts!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mother Shadow shook her head slightly, "My child, don't have too high expectations of Dragon Isle. It is not a dragon paradise, only welcoming to extremely powerful dragons.</p><p></p><p>No one will show you more leniency just for being hatchlings. In fact, my enemies who couldn't defeat me may well target you three children to take revenge on me instead.</p><p></p><p>This is also one reason why I chose to come to the Cloudrealm Mountains to await your births."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "The relations between powerful dragons are unexpectedly poor..."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mother Shadow said, "It's not entirely like that. I do have friends, but that doesn't make it any safer for you."</p><p></p><p>Suhao calculated silently, "Two months, just the time needed for my Genesis Egg to hatch and mature. Which means when I arrive at Dragon Isle, I can store my main body in the secondary realm while using my Divine Avatar to walk outside and receive the 'soul seed' to study soul power. Most crucially, in two months I can recover all my strength..."</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, when Suhao returned to Dragon Isle, he could directly overthrow the Dragon God's rule and become the Dragon King.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Dragon Mother Shadow said, "However, Leian, at the next island we'll stay an extra day. I will guide you on properly using your innate 'pinpoint accuracy' ability."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Guidance? Dragon Mother, I feel I've already mastered using my 'pinpoint accuracy' quite well, no need for further training."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mother Shadow said, "Leian, my child, I very much appreciate your self-confidence, but overconfidence is unwise. By saying that, you've only reinforced my determination to guide you in using your abilities until you meet my requirements."</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself, "Requirements? Simple, I can customize to any requirements."</p>

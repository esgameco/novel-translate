        <h1>Chapter 573</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In less than two minutes, Su Hao appeared beside A Xing with A Wang, saying, "You two stay here first. I'll go resolve the disaster now, which will take some time." </p><p></p><p>After speaking, he grabbed some food and water from behind and handed it to them, then disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>After searching for a while, he found the core of this strange disaster under a tree.</p><p></p><p>It was a glass ball toy the size of a fist. An adorable doll lay quietly inside the hollow glass ball, gazing up at the sky. Its eyes had lost their color, but one could vaguely see they were originally a deep blue.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps some no longer young person had buried their most precious childhood toy here, symbolizing the end of their childhood!</p><p></p><p>But by chance, it had turned into a disaster.</p><p></p><p>So you see, burying toys randomly in this world is not right......</p><p></p><p>He didn't rush to break the glass ball toy. Instead, he moved closer, closed his eyes, and used his spiritual feelers to carefully sense the operating principle of this core, trying to find a way to divide the space into independent cubes.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Su Hao opened his eyes, opened his palm, and began constructing a space structure the size of a tennis ball in his palm, then generated and stacked numerous modules inside the palm space ball.</p><p></p><p>Two minutes later, he casually broke off a tree branch as thick as an arm with leaves from a nearby tree, about three meters long, and Su Hao stuffed the large branch into the space ball in his palm.</p><p></p><p>If someone had seen this scene, they would have had to bulge their eyes out.</p><p></p><p>A branch two to three meters long and wide stuffed into a ball smaller than a fist......</p><p></p><p>Is that possible? Who's joking, is this world joking?</p><p></p><p>But there are too many unbelievable things that go beyond imagination to say they don't exist. You can only say you haven't seen them before!</p><p></p><p>In fact, the branch didn't shrink. Su Hao's palm space ball wasn't as small as it looked - the space inside was extremely large. If you shifted your perspective into the space ball, you would find the surrounding space was vast, more than enough to fit a small tree branch.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, if Su Hao wished, he could further increase the capacity of the palm space ball!</p><p></p><p>Gaining this new skill, Su Hao was so excited that he couldn't control the goosebumps all over his body.</p><p></p><p>He had gained many abilities before, but this one he accidentally gained today was different.</p><p></p><p>This was an independent space!</p><p></p><p>Like a prison, experimental field, public space......</p><p></p><p>He had researched in this direction in the Summoner's World before, but no matter how he tried, he ultimately couldn't achieve this function. He thought it was impossible to realize! He never expected to gain it today!</p><p></p><p>The special barrier separating the spaces showed a tendency to be stretched to the limit!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself, "It seems this ratio is about the extreme limit. To expand further, I may need to strengthen the barrier's intensity. But it's enough."</p><p></p><p>After studying it for a while more and finding no issues, he reached out and grabbed the doll from inside the glass ball toy. Applying force with his fingers...</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao crushed the doll's body into pieces. Its head turned into a small pile of source pearls in a dazzling white light, scattering on the ground.</p><p></p><p>As for the glass ball, it was the source vessel left behind by this strange disaster.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the glass ball source vessel, Su Hao flashed and appeared beside A Xing and A Wang.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he appeared, A Xing jumped up excitedly, "The disaster is resolved?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "That's right! It's been resolved. The strange effects here will disappear in a moment."</p><p></p><p>A Xing asked expectantly, "What about the source vessel?"</p><p></p><p>As long as they had the source vessel, it would prove this strange disaster was resolved by their 'Wind Sun Yang Wang Xing Squad', definitely boosting their reputation further.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao spread his hands, "This source vessel is rather special, so I took it away. As for the explanation, you can think about how to deal with it!"</p><p></p><p>A Xing was stunned, "So it seems this strange disaster had similarities to A Yang's abilities. I understand, leave the rest to me!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I have other things to do, I'll go first."</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao left, A Xing laughed heartily, "I just knew no matter what strange disaster, it couldn't stump A Yang. As expected! We wandered here for four days without finding anything weird, but A Yang just came and resolved it so quickly. So powerful, befitting a member of our squad! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>A Wang said speechlessly, "A Xing, wake up. Whether A Yang is powerful or not has nothing to do with being in our squad or not!</p><p></p><p>We can only say our squad's nickname 'Lucky Star Squad' is quite accurate - our luck is pretty good!"</p><p></p><p>But A Xing didn't care about that. Since the strange disaster was resolved, he hooked A Wang's neck and said, "Let's go report it and collect the reward."</p><p></p><p>A Wang said, "Without the source vessel, how will you collect the reward?"</p><p></p><p>A Xing waved his hand, "Do we need the source vessel? Who doesn't know our Lucky Star Squad specializes in resolving strange disasters?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, A Wang also laughed, "You're right, A Xing is indeed a worthy leader."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After returning to the experimental base, Su Hao had one more source vessel collection, and inspired by the source vessel, he developed the 'Small World' ability from the space ball ability.</p><p></p><p>As for the uses of the Small World, there was one for now - putting the entire Hulu Island into the Small World, turning it into a mobile base that could move anytime, with the key benefit of concealment!</p><p></p><p>A Shan and Feng Cheng floated in the air, watching wide-eyed as Su Hao lifted up a huge island, then stuffed it into a ball with a two-meter diameter, almost dropping their jaws.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know why, but seeing this scene, they felt utterly dissonant, unable to imagine how it was done at all.</p><p></p><p>Wait! Was this done by the Mighty One?</p><p></p><p>Then it's fine, nothing to be surprised about......</p><p></p><p>The Mighty One being able to do things they couldn't imagine was perfectly normal, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>A Shan and Feng Cheng flew to Su Hao's side, looking at the large ball beside him, clearly reflecting the image of an island - wasn't this their Hulu Island? Only it had shrunk by at least a million times compared to before.</p><p></p><p>The two looked at this small island, like deities looking down on all living beings in the world. It was an incredibly miraculous experience.</p><p></p><p>A Shan marveled, "Mighty One, how did you do this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "This is a small spatial ability I call the Small World. It seems quite useful."</p><p></p><p>A Shan and Feng Cheng looked at Su Hao with wide eyes, as if asking if they could learn it too.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to hide this, so Su Hao casually uploaded it, "The All-Purpose Assistant has an explanation. Feel free to try if you're interested, but I can't guarantee you'll be able to learn it."</p><p></p><p>These two hadn't even learned the 'Opposing Spatial Barrier' skill, let alone these advanced derivative skills.</p><p></p><p>The Small World skill seemed simple when Su Hao used it, but was actually quite difficult, even harder than the 'Second Space' skill.</p><p></p><p>But the two didn't believe they couldn't learn it and excitedly opened the All-Purpose Assistant to check it out.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took the lead entering the 'Small World', "Let's go, see how the effect is."</p>

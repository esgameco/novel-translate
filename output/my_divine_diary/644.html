        <h1>Chapter 644</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It was the same old place.</p><p></p><p>Outside Red Ice Star No. 1 satellite.</p><p></p><p>This time, the distance was even more remote, reaching 8 billion kilometers away. Even light would take nearly 8 hours to travel that far.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was still quietly floating not far from the 'Genesis', signaling to Ya Shan: "Ya Shan, you can launch the spacecraft now."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the entire spacecraft violently shook, and three thick pillars of light dozens of meters wide suddenly blasted out from the three large nozzles, instantly shooting towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>It was like using a stick to push a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>The 'Genesis' was the mosquito at the end of that stick...</p><p></p><p>Under the violent thrusting force that was almost explosive, the spacecraft accelerated rapidly, shooting farther and farther away, going faster and faster. In no time, it had traveled out several thousand meters, and its speed was still increasing.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao showed a smile: "It's a success!"</p><p></p><p>"It's just not known what the ultimate speed limit is. In theory, the maximum speed the spacecraft can reach should be equal to the ejection speed of the thrusters! Which is 100,000 meters per second...one three-thousandth of the speed of light...so slow!"</p><p></p><p>And this was just the extreme speed limit of this spacecraft, whether it could even reach that limit was still uncertain!</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang--"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao suddenly heard a dull impact sound, followed by an enormously powerful force that struck him, causing him to lose balance and fly backwards.</p><p></p><p>He saw three crystal-shining armored figures collide into a ball, tumbling and shooting in the direction the spacecraft was traveling.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help cursing: "F**k!"</p><p></p><p>Realizing speech couldn't be heard in the vacuum, he transmitted telepathically: "You two idiots! Blinking and teleporting will preserve your previous relative motion inertia, so don't randomly blink on the spacecraft!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng finally regained their balance, exchanging an embarrassed look.</p><p></p><p>A strange thought popped into their minds: "The first intimate contact with the Great Lord Wei?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued: "Why did you come out? What's the status of the spacecraft's operation?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan transmitted: "Great Lord Wei, the spacecraft is operating normally! Consistent with projections."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Let's go back to the spacecraft."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, his figure disappeared and teleported to the 'teleportation room' inside the spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>This was a dedicated teleportation point added by Su Hao inside the spacecraft, a spherical space with a diameter of one thousand meters, located in the center of the spacecraft, specifically used to buffer the spacecraft's speed so that those teleporting back wouldn't directly crash into the interior facilities.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they did crash, it would probably damage the spacecraft, not Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>The moment Su Hao appeared in the teleportation room, the cotton wall behind him suddenly slammed towards him at an extreme speed. Fortunately, Su Hao was prepared, his immense spiritual power surging out in layers to act as a buffer.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>With a dull sound, Su Hao immediately stabilized himself, using his spiritual sense to scan and confirm the up and down orientations. In reality, there was no real up or down, just confirming the direction the spacecraft was facing.</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao confirmed the direction and steadied himself, two figures appeared beside him, crashing backwards before quickly stopping and regaining balance.</p><p></p><p>It was Ya Shan and Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng excitedly clenched his fists: "So thrilling!"</p><p></p><p>The three went to the control room and saw Fei Yao skillfully analyzing data and operating in front of numerous display screens, as if piloting a spacecraft was an extremely simple matter for him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao and the others enter, Fei Yao excitedly said: "The spacecraft's performance has met all standards, even exceeding original projections. At this acceleration rate, it will quickly reach the theoretical maximum speed. Such a spacecraft is amazing!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao glanced around the control room, quickly analyzing the current data, and soon nodded: "Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao briefly introduced the various data points, then pointed to one indicator and said: "However, the nozzle exterior temperature is rising a bit too quickly. Although there are array protections and special cooling measures, it can only last for an hour at most before needing to shut down and wait for cooling. The cooling time is probably about two hours."</p><p></p><p>Accelerating for one hour, resting for two hours...</p><p></p><p>Still acceptable!</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the group tested various facilities and equipment on the spacecraft, including launching single-person spacecraft, probes, mining vehicles, etc.</p><p></p><p>This would be their future living space, so the stability of daily living and working was extremely important.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until a month later that the four of them completed testing all the machinery.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The small world inside the spacecraft took the shape of a sphere, divided into upper and lower sections, with the lower section being the workshop and experiment area, and the upper section being the living island.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the island and looking up, it was like standing in your own courtyard, gazing up at the brilliant starry sky, with twinkling stars sprinkling light onto the island's land, creating an extraordinarily beautiful sight.</p><p></p><p>This could really be called a panoramic skylight on a spacecraft!</p><p></p><p>Walking on the island was no different from walking on the source planet, basically able to ignore the effects of the zero-gravity space environment.</p><p></p><p>The reason was because of a special array Su Hao mastered - Contraction!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, accumulating more knowledge is never wrong, for who can say when it might come in useful in the future?</p><p></p><p>Celebrating the successful launch of the spacecraft! Celebrating taking the first step towards the vast starry ocean.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, each of them imagined what they might encounter in the universe in the future.</p><p></p><p>Would they meet all kinds of strange planets? Cosmic monsters? Or perhaps other travelers like themselves, piloting spacecraft to roam the starry seas?</p><p></p><p>As long as they kept venturing forward, everything they could imagine would happen.</p><p></p><p>After eating and drinking their fill, Feng Cheng lay on the grass, gazing at the stars. Suddenly a strange doubt arose, and he couldn't help asking: "Great Lord Wei, what do you think the full picture of this universe looks like?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and shook his head: "That's something I want to know too."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan also sighed: "Compared to the universe, we are so tiny! There's probably no way for us to know its full picture."</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao also silently looked at the stars, saying nothing.</p><p></p><p>They were quite fortunate, at least able to take the first step into the universe. How many lives were born and died on planets in silence?</p><p></p><p>It was like a tiny ant crawling on a tree, able to see the bark and leaves in front of it. It might only want to know what the tree looked like, but could never truly see it no matter what.</p><p></p><p>If it was fortunately blown into the sky by the wind, and its eyesight was also fortunately excellent enough to overlook the tree, it would know what the tree it was climbing looked like.</p><p></p><p>But then, doubts would only increase: what about the forest the tree was in, the continent the forest was on, the planet the continent was part of...</p><p></p><p>How were Su Hao and the others different from that ant blown into the sky?</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's eyes sparkled.</p><p></p><p>That's right! As long as they followed the Great Lord Wei, it didn't matter how vast the universe was!</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao stared blankly at Su Hao, inwardly musing: "So this is the source of Mr. Jia Wei's charisma? Such powerful bearing!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Su Hao sensed an anomaly in his spiritual tentacles. After briefly checking, he immediately discovered the source: "Huh? The positioning stones on the source planet have been destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>At first Su Hao thought it was just one of his positioning stones being accidentally discovered and destroyed like an ordinary rock. But he soon realized it wasn't just one that was destroyed, they were being destroyed one after another in succession!</p><p></p><p>"What's happening on the source planet?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately turned to Ya Shan and Feng Cheng: "Ya Shan, Feng Cheng, are there any anomalies with the positioning stones you left on the source planet?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng snapped out of it and checked the status of their spiritual tentacles.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan was stunned: "Dozens of my positioning stones are being destroyed one after another."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also said: "Mine too."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's expression became solemn as he inwardly thought: "Perhaps, it has come!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 906</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Three months passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the intense battle with the Crimson Demon King some time ago, the brother and sister Cong Shuling became famous throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>They were hailed as the 'New World Heroes' by all intelligent beings.</p><p></p><p>Those who had previously looked down upon the two siblings, thinking they were just lucky, could no longer utter any insults after seeing the entire island where the Crimson Demon King resided had sunk into the sea.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even say the slightly 'insulting' words 'just lucky'.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the brother and sister was recognized by everyone, who willingly called them 'heroes'. After all, for so many years, there was no one who could stand before the Crimson Demon King and fight him blow for blow!</p><p></p><p>Let alone fighting an intense battle with him and still being alive and kicking.</p><p></p><p>Everyone believed that the hope of defeating the Crimson Demon King now rested on these two, Cong Shuling.</p><p></p><p>However, the brother and sister did not gloat about this. They understood the battle better than anyone, so after recovering from their injuries, they left the World of Heroes and came to hide on the Varan Continent.</p><p></p><p>They went into seclusion to cultivate, waiting for the day their divine skills were fully accomplished, which would be the time to go out and settle the score with the Crimson Demon King.</p><p></p><p>In a small town on the Varan Continent, there was a courtyard surrounded by blossoming flowers, which was the temporary dwelling where the two siblings were cultivating in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Today, Cong Renfei pushed open the door and entered from outside. Seeing his sister watering the flowers, he couldn't help but say, "Sister, do you still remember the folk song 'The happy fish swims through the long distant river, its reflection in the clear water like the most beloved maiden'?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling was slightly stunned, then nodded and said, "It was popular all over the rivers and lakes back then, how could I not remember? I can even sing it!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei continued, "When I went out for a stroll earlier, I heard a courtesan singing this folk song. There were some differences, but not much."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling exclaimed in shock, "Little Fei, you actually went to a brothel? How could you..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei blushed, "Sister, that's not the point. The point is, this folk song was clearly a classic from our previous life, so how did it appear in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling quickly recovered from the shock of her brother visiting a brothel and asked in astonishment, "Are you telling the truth?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Absolutely true. I even paid a hefty sum to privately ask that courtesan about it."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling asked in amazement, "How could this be? Could our master have passed it down?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei shook his head, "Impossible. It's questionable whether our master has even heard of this song. According to him, he hasn't been to our hometown for nearly two hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this folk song is said to have spread from a place called Haide Town. That town recently suffered a tsunami, with many casualties, but it recovered quickly and even produced a large number of talented builders who constructed the town in an extraordinary way. It's now quite famous, and many people have flocked there.</p><p></p><p>This folk song was sung to inspire people to overcome the difficulties during that time."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling frowned, immediately ruling out the words 'coincidence' and 'similarity'.</p><p></p><p>She believed there were coincidences in the world, but if this was a coincidence, it was too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling put down the watering can, then stood up and said, "Where is Haide Town? Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei immediately nodded, "I was thinking the same. If we encounter fellow countrymen..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said firmly, "Even if we meet countrymen, don't reveal it. Don't rashly recognize them or carelessly expose our identities. Caution is paramount."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Understood, sister."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Haide Town.</p><p></p><p>The devastation from the tsunami was still visible, with piles of debris yet to be cleared, making the area look like a huge junkyard.</p><p></p><p>On the flat ground beyond the debris, rows of neat but simple temporary shelters were erected, where the remaining residents of Haide Town were temporarily living.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional travelers hid themselves very well...</p><p></p><p>Well, only some of them hid very well. A small portion could no longer contain their inner restlessness and came out to organize the post-disaster reconstruction work.</p><p></p><p>Out of the one hundred dimensional travelers, there were bound to be differing ideas.</p><p></p><p>Initially, all the dimensional travelers thought they were the only one who had crossed over, but after the first one inadvertently exposed himself, all of them became suspicious.</p><p></p><p>As usual, Luo Yanfeng carried a piece of wood, walking through the crowded temporary settlement area, his eyes behind his long hair furtively observing the passers-by, as if searching for something.</p><p></p><p>However, he was very careful, not revealing any clues, chanting the slogans in unison with the other civilians, encouraging each other's morale to rebuild their hometown.</p><p></p><p>Only he knew in his heart what he was looking for: "Evidence shows that I'm not the only one who has crossed over. My initial estimate is at least thirty, no more, no less.</p><p></p><p>Four who have already publicly exposed themselves - one taking command, one singing, one cursing, and one actively recognizing others and exposing himself. These four have started calling each other countrymen and addressing each other as brothers.</p><p></p><p>Based on my observations, there are another twenty townspeople suspected of being dimensional travelers, but they have not actively exposed themselves. After discovering the other four, they deliberately hid their identities. I only noticed them through subtle details, but I can't confirm if it's true or not.</p><p></p><p>So, just how many dimensional travelers are there?"</p><p></p><p>At first, he also thought he was the only dimensional traveler. He had learned some miscellaneous knowledge and considered himself more knowledgeable than the people of this world, almost unable to resist coming out to guide the others.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could make that decision, someone else had already jumped out first, right next to him, shouting curses with a strong hometown accent that almost made him flee on the spot.</p><p></p><p>He was terrified at that moment, his hands and feet became clumsy, and he accidentally kicked a stone, falling flat on his face. This, however, concealed his abnormality.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he had many thoughts - excitement, confusion, terror, a complex array of emotions welled up inside him.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he made a decision: to hide himself and not expose his identity.</p><p></p><p>Now, three months had passed, and he thought he had done a good job, noticing many details.</p><p></p><p>As Luo Yanfeng pondered, he suddenly considered a possibility: "Or perhaps, everyone in this small town is a dimensional traveler..."</p><p></p><p>This thought made his mind pause for a moment, and it took him a long time to recover: "No, it's unlikely that everyone is a dimensional traveler. Based on my observations, the people of this world don't live as particular as the dimensional travelers. Public defecation is very common... whereas the dimensional travelers are the opposite, they place great importance on personal hygiene..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Luo Yanfeng examined himself: "Hmm, with my filthy appearance, no one should suspect me." Regardless, in a situation where friend or foe is unknown, he absolutely could not expose his identity as a dimensional traveler. While ensuring his own concealment, he should try to identify as many dimensional travelers as possible. Just in case."</p><p></p><p>In fact, this 'search for dimensional travelers' game had begun as soon as the first one was exposed.</p><p></p><p>"Ahâ€”murder!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng was startled and ran towards the direction of the shrill screams along with a group of workers.</p><p></p><p>Finally, behind a pile of debris, he saw an extremely bloody scene: four people lying in pools of blood in various poses, showing no signs of life.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng was as if struck by lightning.</p><p></p><p>A great terror descended upon him, his heart pounding: "Sure enough, the thing I feared most has happened...these four exposed dimensional travelers have been killed! Why did this happen? We all crossed over from the same place, why would we kill each other...There are no conflicts of interest between us, are there?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, he suppressed the fear in his heart and quickly analyzed the situation: "No, that's not right! Perhaps the existence of other dimensional travelers is a serious challenge to their authority. In other words, as long as they eliminate all dimensional travelers except themselves, the last one standing will be the ultimate victor, able to enjoy everything this world has to offer!"</p><p></p><p>He took a few deep breaths, his mind becoming clearer: "I must hide myself well, and then find an opportunity to leave this place. I need to confirm whether there are also dimensional travelers in other cities and towns..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The deities gathered in the Celestial Realm cursed and ranted: "Damn it, the World Wills are actually killing each other? Have they gone mad or what..."</p><p></p><p>They were on high alert, but how could they have foreseen that before any external enemies arrived, the internal forces had already started fighting.</p><p></p><p>"I thought this batch of World Wills would be easier to handle. Who knew that despite looking proper on the surface, they would act so foolishly when it came to real action."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be an issue with the World Wills' inherent competitive mechanism? Like parasites, they need to determine the strongest victor."</p><p></p><p>"Did Leian mention anything like that when he told us about them? And look at the Gale siblings, they get along just fine, don't they?"</p><p></p><p>"This batch of World Wills is difficult to handle!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 854</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Upon having this thought, Su Hao immediately contacted Yashan and Feng Chengdao: "Yashan, Feng Cheng, come back, let's search again, but this time focus specifically on searching stars."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng were stunned: "Stars?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said in astonishment: "Old Master Su, I tried before, but it seems I can't enter the interior of stars, I can only observe their outer layers."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "It's okay, I can't enter the interiors of stars either, we'll just search as deeply as we can. If searching stars still yields no discoveries, then there's nothing we can do and we'll have to continue exploring outwards."</p><p></p><p>The two of them understood and began searching right away.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao calmed his mind, and in order to better concentrate, he voluntarily retracted his smaller selves, shrinking from the original five thousand down to three thousand.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin! Although the odds are low, what if it did happen? If Bai Jia'er truly was born on a star, with our previous search method, we might not find him even after two hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Su Hao's three thousand smaller selves dispersed outwards, heading straight for the dazzlingly brilliant stars in the star-observing realm.</p><p></p><p>Immense yet beautiful, yet filled with lethal energy.</p><p></p><p>Could life be born on planets like these?</p><p></p><p>No one could give a definite answer. Even Su Hao, who had wandered the universe for so many years, did not know whether life could arise on stars.</p><p></p><p>Did things he had never seen simply not exist?</p><p></p><p>The wonders of the vast universe exceeded all imagination.</p><p></p><p>One could even say, wherever there was imagination, the universe's marvels were sure to surpass it.</p><p></p><p>Like the infinite positive numbers on the number line, no matter how large a number anyone imagined, there were sure to be even larger ones.</p><p></p><p>So for Su Hao, the possibility of life arising on stars could not be ruled out!</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps very soon, I'll find out whether stars can give birth to life or not."</p><p></p><p>Compared to planets, there were far fewer stars, so with the three of them searching with purpose, their speed was quite fast.</p><p></p><p>Around a month later, Feng Cheng suddenly sent a message to the group: "Holy crap, Old Master Su, Old Master Yashan, I think I've got something here."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng then sent the location of the star he was at to the group, and also took a photo: "This is a red giant star that looks like it's about to die. At one spot on this red giant, I discovered something that looks like the Ten-Colored Plate."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Hao and Yashan were both shaken, thinking to themselves: "Found it!"</p><p></p><p>But neither of them had ever imagined that Bai Jia'er would be born on a red giant star.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's smaller selves quickly arrived at the red giant star that Feng Cheng mentioned.</p><p></p><p>This red giant was immensely huge, with a diameter over a hundred times larger than an ordinary star. Other celestial bodies seemed like insignificant grains of sand before it, like an enormously large fireball floating in midair, burning fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The stars seen in the "Galactic Network" were somewhat different from the actual stars, apart from color differences. One could not sense the stars' majestic grandeur in the "Galactic Network."</p><p></p><p>However, the material details were precisely the same down to the smallest particulars.</p><p></p><p>A red giant was a relatively short stage that a star went through towards the end of its life cycle. Compared to regular stars, it was quite unstable, with a lifespan ranging from just a few hundred thousand years to a few million years depending on its mass.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's three thousand smaller selves simultaneously landed on this red giant and began carefully searching it.</p><p></p><p>As he searched, he pondered the possibility of Bai Jia'er being born on a red giant.</p><p></p><p>"A red giant star...is the result of a star's nuclear fusion fuel running low, unable to produce enough energy to support its stable outward radiation, breaking the balance of gravity...the core contracts, with density, pressure and temperature all increasing explosively, while the outer shell expands and rapidly cools...during this period of violent change in a star, it is indeed possible for special life forms like the Ten-Colored Plate to be born. And this probability is much higher than the core of a star in its prime or an ordinary planet."</p><p></p><p>Soon, as Su Hao entered the interior of the red giant, a drifting plate suddenly floated by in front of his eyes. It seemed to disregard the raging energy storms on the red giant, drifting steadily. At times it became ethereal, as if entering a "dimension-shifting" state, then regained a solid form, only to turn into a beam of light shooting into the sea of flames and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Ten-Colored Plate!"</p><p></p><p>Found it!</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw the Ten-Colored Plate on the red giant, Su Hao's mind raced, connecting all the information he had previously gathered, while rapidly solving the problems he had encountered in studying Bai Jia'er, one by one.</p><p></p><p>Finally condensing it into four words: "So that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao analyzed to himself: "During the process of a star shedding into a red giant, this immense celestial body underwent violent changes, causing the three elements required for soul force generation to be met within the red giant. This violent process of change probably lasted a few hundred million years - long yet short. Amidst countless unbelievable coincidences, this peculiar life form was born.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps not every red giant gives birth to these Ten-Colored Plate lifeforms, but among the myriad red giants in the universe, there is bound to be one that happens to satisfy the conditions for birth, successfully giving rise to them - just as not every planet spawns life, but there are always planets that, by a confluence of myriad coincidences, manage to produce life."</p><p></p><p>As he analyzed, he began wandering around the red giant, observing the Bai Jia'er there.</p><p></p><p>The Bai Jia'er here were quite sparse and scattered, requiring a long time to come across one by chance.</p><p></p><p>As he encountered more and more Bai Jia'er, he discovered an amazing thing - the Bai Jia'er he saw were all particularly small, less than half the size of those deities.</p><p></p><p>At first he thought he was just seeing Bai Jia'er younglings, so it was normal for them to be smaller. But it couldn't be that every single Bai Jia'er he encountered was that tiny!</p><p></p><p>This state reminded Su Hao of the "thought elongation" phenomenon of the Eighteen Deities.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps as I guessed, the original Bai Jia'er's thoughts were in an 'extreme elongated' state, with a single thought spanning days or even months, yet they themselves were unable to perceive this phenomenon."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Yashan sent a message: "Old Master Su, I've discovered an energy ejection point on the circumference of this red giant, with Bai Jia'er occasionally being ejected from it."</p><p></p><p>He then sent the specific location to the group.</p><p></p><p>Although the three of them were all in the "Galactic Network" observing this red giant, they could not see each other.</p><p></p><p>After entering the "Galactic Network", each person could only see celestial material, unable to see others who had also entered.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the "Galactic Network" was a "single-player game" - an independent realm for each person who entered it.</p><p></p><p>But as long as anyone shared a location, the others could quickly find that specific spot based on the location information.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Su Hao used the location provided by Yashan to find the energy ejection point he mentioned.</p><p></p><p>This energy ejection point was immense, initially estimated to be large enough to fit an entire Cruciform Star...</p><p></p><p>But compared to the red giant's colossal size, it was just a tiny "needle hole".</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waited a moment and sure enough, saw Bai Jia'er being ejected from this "needle hole", then falling back into the star's interior under its gravitational pull.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps Bai Jia'er is born even deeper inside the red giant, let me go take a look."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Su Hao willed himself into the needle hole, rapidly exploring inwards.</p><p></p><p>Although the red giant had already shed into this form after exhausting its stellar fuel, it was still a star, and the raging forces and extreme temperatures made Su Hao feel the true meaning of power.</p><p></p><p>The strength he currently commanded was nothing before celestial bodies like this.</p><p></p><p>Even if he mastered the source of an entire planet, at most it could produce a tiny burst on a form like this.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Su Hao stopped exploring further into the red giant's interior, as like vigorous stars, he could not penetrate deeper in the "Galactic Network".</p><p></p><p>Su Hao did not force it, instead idly wandering around at the limit of depth he could reach.</p><p></p><p>This time he intended to carefully observe this red giant. If he could find Bai Jia'er's direct birthplace, that would be even better - he could simulate that environment to reproduce the conditions and hopefully quickly obtain his own pure soul force.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't find Bai Jia'er's birthplace, it was fine, he could deduce Bai Jia'er's suitable environment from their distribution on this red giant.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Su Hao revealed a smile: "Don't I still have eighteen obedient Bai Jia'er in my hands? If all else fails, I'll just have them come help me test it out personally."</p>

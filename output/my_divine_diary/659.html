        <h1>Chapter 659</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>For Ling Baihua and the other four, exploring planets was itself an exciting endeavor. Regardless of whether there were any gains, the important thing was the process of exploration itself.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao's current purpose was very strong. Obtaining what he wanted meant more to him.</p><p></p><p>He was still far from reaching the point where he could explore carelessly.  </p><p></p><p>After indulging themselves on various planets for a whole month, the group returned to the spaceship.</p><p></p><p>Everyone began to showcase their gains.</p><p></p><p>What Yashan, Feng Cheng and Fei Diao brought back were some unfamiliar, peculiar substances.</p><p></p><p>As for Ling Baihua and the others, the things they brought back were bizarre and strange - they were simply things that caught their eye, but had no real use for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they could only serve as the five's personal planetary collectibles.</p><p></p><p>But whatever, as long as they had fun. The real collector of substances for Su Hao was the 'Exploration Cube', not these few pitiful human resources.</p><p></p><p>For the next two years, Su Hao and the others would remain in the Mumingxing galaxy, waiting for the Exploration Cube to finish collecting unknown substances, then undergo a supernova explosion to filter out special sensory substances. After that, they would depart for another galaxy to continue exploring.</p><p></p><p>After the others dispersed, Su Hao returned to his meditation room and reviewed the 'Spirit Technique of Breaking the Surface with a Point' again. After confirming there were no issues with the theory and practice, he planned to attempt breaking through his current spiritual power limit using this technique.</p><p></p><p>Through the attempts of Ling Baihua's group over the past decades, he had obtained a method to break through spiritual limits. It wasn't mature, but it was feasible without major side effects.</p><p></p><p>The reason he wanted to make a breakthrough now was because he hoped to sense the 'Catastrophe System' energy flow during the upcoming supernova explosion with his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Whether he could succeed or not remained to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Step one, different breakthrough directions have different visualization methods, first choose a breakthrough point..."</p><p></p><p>On this, Su Hao had already made his choice - vibration perception. </p><p></p><p>If it didn't work, he would try 'energy perception' next time.</p><p></p><p>"Step two, begin adjusting the spiritual power structure to construct the 'spiritual focus system'."</p><p></p><p>This focus system was different from the one used to convert matter into source energy. It formed a wave-like serrated elliptical system, in order to disperse and gather energy to prevent 'burning out' the spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The energy required to break through spiritual limits was much lower than converting matter into source energy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The 'Technique of Breaking the Surface with a Point' sounded rapid, but in reality it required long-term cultivation to achieve a breakthrough at a certain moment.</p><p></p><p>Once cultivation involved spiritual power, there was no such thing as 'fast'.</p><p></p><p>Even if someone handed Su Hao an 'ultra-fast' spiritual cultivation technique, he wouldn't dare practice it.</p><p></p><p>Because by the end, the spiritual power probably wouldn't have increased, but the person would have gone insane first.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao prioritized protecting his consciousness and consciousness information above all else. Without absolute assurance, he wouldn't act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>After nearly a year of such quiet cultivation, Su Hao's spiritual power finally gained some enhancement.</p><p></p><p>It was like a small bud sprouting on a large circle.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough seemed small and insignificant, but it was still an entirely new breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the 'Spirit Technique of Breaking the Surface with a Point' was effective for him!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao opened his eyes and ended his cultivation for the day.</p><p></p><p>"This cultivation method will greatly compress the growth space of spiritual power in other aspects and concentrate the power on the point of breakthrough. But for me, this is perfect, since my spiritual power in other aspects has no more 'growth space' to speak of."</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he would practice consciousness power cultivation every day, but his spiritual power had made no progress for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>This successful breakthrough allowed Su Hao to see hope for strengthening his spiritual power again.</p><p></p><p>He first checked on the current status of the 'Exploration Cube' and seeing no abnormalities, casually opened the star map.</p><p></p><p>They had traveled at light speed for eighty years, so logically they should be very far from the source star now. However, on the star map, it was only a small distance.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the sensory substance I'm looking for? Perhaps in ordinary galaxies, I can't find any trace of it! Should I explore some more special galactic systems?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Su Hao decided to first proceed at the normal pace, exploring for a few hundred more years before considering those unknown galactic systems.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was going to his death, he would wait until finishing the current research work first...</p><p></p><p>Another year later, with all preparations complete, Su Hao once again deployed a 'Star Shattering Cube' towards the outermost planet.</p><p></p><p>Then he floated quietly in space, eyes closed, trying to sense the various energy fluctuations when the planet was destroyed, recording all the perceived information for later analysis.</p><p></p><p>A few months later, they completed the information collection work, and piloted the spaceship away from this galaxy, heading into the unknown.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, another two hundred years passed.</p><p></p><p>In these two hundred years, they did many things, yet it felt like they did nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>They had found 135 types of 'Seeker' substances, all the way up to 'Seeker 135', meaning Su Hao had obtained at least over a hundred ways to observe the universe.</p><p></p><p>However, the 'Catastrophe System' sensory substance he was looking for still showed no trace.</p><p></p><p>The breakthroughs in spirit also could not allow him to observe what he wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that continuing on would yield no results.</p><p></p><p>And the deepest feeling these two hundred years gave everyone on the spaceship was 'loneliness'!</p><p></p><p>Having only been roaming in space for three hundred years, they had already felt the silence that permeated the universe.</p><p></p><p>Planets, planets... all kinds of planets!</p><p></p><p>No matter how lively they appeared, they could not conceal one common fact: a lack of life.</p><p></p><p>Lifeless planets were so desolate.</p><p></p><p>Even the colorful beauty of this universe had not been appreciated by any life.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people facing such cosmic loneliness would inevitably feel deep despair towards this universe.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the people on the spaceship were not ordinary, with an extraordinary tolerance for loneliness.</p><p></p><p>Take Su Hao for example, if he had an endless life, he could endure such a lonely environment for at least 100 million years...</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he did not have an endless life yet.</p><p></p><p>100 million years meant nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>That day, Su Hao piloted the spaceship for the final scheduled warp, transporting to a galaxy called Tuofengxing.</p><p></p><p>Tuofengxing had an immense mass, nearly a thousand times that of the source star - the largest galaxy Su Hao had visited so far.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, this star seemed to have entered old age, its enormous size causing it to consume a vast amount of energy every second, shortening its lifespan considerably compared to smaller, more stable stars.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao felt that perhaps within such a massive galaxy, he could find what he was looking for.</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked, "Elder Su, should we search for life on the source-like planets first?"</p><p></p><p>After so many disappointments, everyone still held a glimmer of hope of finding life, which was perhaps the joy in exploring galaxy after galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Of course, we'll explore planet five first."</p><p></p><p>There were no cheers, but everyone waited quietly yet eagerly for the spaceship to land.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they returned to the ship disappointed once again.</p><p></p><p>Apart from some special collectibles, it was a complete failure.</p><p></p><p>It was like a desert traveler, crossing one dune after another, always hoping the next dune would reveal a different scene.</p><p></p><p>Yet it remained an endless desert.</p><p></p><p>After ravaging Tuofengxing, the group took off again, flying deeper into the universe. </p><p></p><p>Su Hao returned to his meditation room, staring blankly at the vast star map: "Where is the sensory substance I'm looking for?"</p><p></p><p>Over these few hundred years, Su Hao had pondered this question every moment.</p><p></p><p>Like an obsession, the more he thought about it, the more he felt he already knew where the 'Catastrophe System' sensory substance was located.</p><p></p><p>But he could never figure out exactly where it would be.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the second, more intense disaster is about to come. Will I be able to get through it safely? What could it be?"</p>

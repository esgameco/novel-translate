        <h1>Chapter 601</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Aside from the deceased white-bearded emperor and the empress who had already become allies with the Qingpeng, the remaining fifteen emperors were all enduring the torment of their souls and a difficult choice.</p><p></p><p>To kill others, or to die themselves?</p><p></p><p>In theory, such a choice was simple - of course one would choose to kill others and live oneself!</p><p></p><p>But the problem was, the emperors present were all somewhat bloodthirsty. How could they simply betray their own clans? They all felt that as the leaders of their clans and kings of the great realm, they should bravely die for their people.</p><p></p><p>The key was, they had some bloodthirsty nature, but not enough. This made it very awkward.</p><p></p><p>Why give them such a difficult choice? It was really troubling...</p><p></p><p>As the emperors agonized, Su Hao looked towards the sweat-drenched Jia Emperor and slowly raised his hand, pointing at him.</p><p></p><p>"Thump!"</p><p></p><p>The slippery Jia Emperor knelt down, begging with a trembling voice: "Mr. Jia Wei, I surrender! I'll confess to anything, just spare my life!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao showed a slight smile, withdrew his finger and said: "It seems you've made a very wise choice! The royal clan will eventually die out, why die with them? Half a year later, no one will recognize you, and you can start anew in a new world, living out your happy remaining days."</p><p></p><p>With Jia Emperor taking the lead, the other emperors also didn't want to die for no reason, and expressed their willingness to cooperate one after another.</p><p></p><p>In their view, as long as they the emperors were still alive, the royal clan still lived, even if others died it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if the list of names was handed over, who could say for sure they would all be eliminated!</p><p></p><p>After resolving the emperors' issues, Su Hao handed them over to Yashan and Feng Cheng to record their confessions, while also assigning Xiao Guang the task of cracking the 'consciousness information' to prevent them from lying or concealing anything.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, he would stay behind alone with the Wizard.</p><p></p><p>With a faint smile, Su Hao said: "I knew I would have to communicate with you, I just didn't expect it would happen in this way. For the inconvenience and trouble I've caused you recently, I sincerely apologize. This is not a good place for conversation, shall we move somewhere else?"</p><p></p><p>The Wizard remained expressionless, with a gentle smile: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually waved his hand, casting a 'Balancing Technique', and transported himself and the Wizard to the temporary reception room in the base's small world. With another casual wave, a pot of tea was brewed. "Please, have a seat."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao poured tea for himself and the Wizard, with wisps of mist rising from the cups and a fragrant aroma spreading.</p><p></p><p>After taking a sip and setting down the cup, Su Hao asked: "Wizard, what is your view on the royal clan that has ruled the world for over a thousand years?"</p><p></p><p>The Wizard pondered: "The royal clan has enjoyed wealth and power for over a thousand years, and has become rotten inside, losing the pioneering spirit of its founding. However, the royal clan's existence has special significance. This thousand-plus years of development and peace, the royal clan deserves credit.</p><p></p><p>The prosperous age you see now, half is due to the Wizards' Association, and the other half to the royal clan.</p><p></p><p>I understand the thinking of you young people - that the royal clan has become corrupt internally, abusing its power and oppressing the people, making you feel indignant and want to overthrow it to establish a sacred nation..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Wizard shook his head and sighed: "Those who view the issue this way are not the first, nor will they be the last. This has happened many times throughout history, and every single time, the Wizards' Association has suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>You don't understand, how difficult life was for the common people in the past - they toiled hard every day yet still could not afford food and clothing for their families. The current situation is already so much better!</p><p></p><p>So if you want to know the Wizards' Association's attitude towards the royal clan, this is it. Unless absolutely necessary, the Wizards' Association will not abandon the royal clan. Because no one knows what this world will become without the royal clan!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "Your conservative view is not wrong - it at least safeguards the interests of the vast majority. But in my view, it is not so. While the royal clan has maintained peace, it has also greatly hindered the pace of social development. Over a thousand years is far too little progress.</p><p></p><p>If I have a chance in the future, I will certainly explain this to you in detail.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, you need not worry about the world descending into chaos without the royal clan. As long as I am around, there will be no chaos! Anyone who dares to make trouble, I have the ability to eliminate them."</p><p></p><p>From Su Hao's calm yet confident tone, the Wizard sensed his immense power, but could only shake his head and sigh, not arguing further.</p><p></p><p>He felt extremely regretful - regretful that he had not met this young yet formidable Jia Wei much earlier. He could have been the ideal successor to lead the Wizards' Association, but alas, his ideology had taken the wrong path and could not be reversed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then brought up his own intentions: "As I mentioned before, one of my purposes in eliminating the royal clan is to demonstrate my absolute power, and then gain the qualification to cooperate with the Wizards' Association. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The Wizard nodded: "If you truly have the ability to wipe out the entire royal clan across the world, you would indeed be qualified to cooperate with the Wizards' Association. However, by replacing the royal clan, you would essentially gain control over everything in this world. What else would you want to cooperate with the Wizards' Association for?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "I want to cooperate with the Wizards' Association to unravel the mysteries of the 'Source'!"</p><p></p><p>The Wizard was stunned, then suddenly laughed: "For so many years, the Wizards' Association has been trying to decipher the mysteries of the Source, but with little progress. What you see is the extent of what we have been able to explore - at most there are some unknown things, but there are no great secrets hidden.</p><p></p><p>Whether we cooperate or not makes no difference."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head: "I think you have misunderstood what I mean by cooperation. What I mean is, the Wizards' Association follows my instructions to collect the data I want from around the world, and I will be the one to unravel the mysteries of the Source."</p><p></p><p>The Wizard's smile faded as he said seriously: "Are you being serious? For thousands of years, countless geniuses have tried in vain to glimpse even a fraction of the Source's mysteries. What makes you so confident you can unravel them? Why would the Wizards' Association indulge in such nonsense with you?"</p><p></p><p>To the Wizard, this was indeed nonsense - just because Su Hao claimed he could unravel the Source's mysteries, all the wizards in the world would have to do his bidding?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked: "Do I look like I'm joking?"</p><p></p><p>The Wizard shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued: "This is something I must do, and the reason I put so much effort into supporting the Glorious Society. I want to tell everyone that I have the ability to destroy anyone or any organization unwilling to cooperate with me. To tell everyone that they only have two choices: follow my instructions to complete the tasks I assign, or die."</p><p></p><p>The Wizard fell silent looking at Su Hao calmly uttering these words: "..."</p><p></p><p>Such a person, coupled with such formidable power - a scourge upon the world!</p><p></p><p>The Wizard didn't believe Su Hao's words - he had seen many evil people convinced they were agents of justice.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then said: "And please don't doubt our research capabilities. Otherwise, what do you think our 'Source Vector Suppression Device' used to restrict abilities is?"</p><p></p><p>The Wizard's spirit jolted as he grasped the key point: "Source Vector Suppression Device?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "Correct, that is one of our research achievements. It can strip all wizards within a 200 kilometer radius of their Source abilities."</p><p></p><p>The Wizard's eyes widened in shock: "What? 200 kilometers?"</p><p></p><p>Against such an enemy, what chance of victory was there? Might as well surrender...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "No need to be so alarmed, that is just one of our research achievements."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Su Hao extended his finger.</p><p></p><p>"Swish--"  </p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>A corner of the reception room suddenly exploded, a shower of stone fragments deflected by a golden membrane.</p><p></p><p>"I am an Explosive Source wizard!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he pointed again, "Crack!" A bolt of lightning burst forth, blue-white electrical light illuminating the room, including the Wizard's astonished face.</p><p></p><p>"I am also a Lightning Source wizard."</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh--"  </p><p>A fire dragon spewed out.</p><p></p><p>"A Fire Source wizard too!"</p><p></p><p>"Puff puff puff!"  </p><p>Numerous metal spikes suddenly erupted from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"I can handle Matter as well!"</p><p></p><p>...</p>

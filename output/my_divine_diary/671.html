        <h1>Chapter 671</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>According to Su Hao's normal process, to start from scratch and reach his previous life's peak state would take at least a dozen years.</p><p></p><p>The steps would roughly be 'blood energy - [bone demon] - radar perception - spatial transmission - planting spirit grass - cultivating immortality'.</p><p></p><p>However, after obtaining the special 'source' in the previous world, Su Hao's process of recovering his powers could be greatly shortened, without needing to follow the set routine.</p><p></p><p>"This body is strong enough. I only need about twenty days to accumulate enough blood energy to reach the level of an advanced elite martial artist. In other words, in just twenty days, I can gain the ability to modify genes!</p><p></p><p>Then by sacrificing some flesh that doesn't affect mobility, I can cultivate a 'gene modification liquid' and draw the 'core compound rune'!</p><p></p><p>The final step is to build a 'small world', set up a 'focus system' within the small world, and obtain a sufficient amount of 'source'!</p><p></p><p>Including commonly used energies like 'blood energy' and 'spirit power'."</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but he could also use various fantasy system abilities related to the source.</p><p></p><p>At that point, Su Hao would be confident in temporarily gaining the ability to survive in space. Even escaping this spacecraft from enemy pursuit would not be impossible!</p><p></p><p>With the key points clear, Su Hao no longer hesitated. He got up and sat cross-legged on the bed, quickly entering a state of meditation to continue refining his blood energy.</p><p></p><p>Refining blood energy was something Su Hao had been doing since his reincarnation whenever he had free time, without the slightest slack. Now he had gained a bit of a sense for it - at most it would take one day to establish a complete 'blood energy system' suited to his body.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in addition to refining blood energy, Su Hao would also take time every day to cultivate his spiritual power, including spiritual tentacles and 'thoughts'!</p><p></p><p>As for the daily training activities of soldiers, Su Hao applied for a month's rest on the grounds of 'comrades dying tragically, mental breakdown, and depression'. Considering he was a 'hero', Captain Yan agreed to Su Hao's request.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, wasn't Captain Yan himself like that?</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The 'Yuanxing' was a very flat-looking spacecraft, like a stingray, yet full of sci-fi beauty.</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxing was painted entirely black, flying in space and perfectly blending into the black background of the starry sky. Without careful observation, there was no way to detect its trace.</p><p></p><p>In a conference room at the front of the Yuanxing, a huge screen at the front was displaying various data analysis results. Thirty-five people in blue and white military uniforms sat around, their expressions serious and the atmosphere solemn. </p><p></p><p>The General Jiang whom Su Hao had met earlier was among them, sitting in a middle position.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man in the white military uniform at the head did not show anger, his brows deeply furrowed as he said in a deep voice, "According to the data analysis, there is over a 50% chance that the Yuanxing has been locked onto by the Eight-Armed Clan's 'Signal Hive'! Now who can tell me what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>A 50% chance was already an astounding number for those present. It was like flipping a coin - if they lost the gamble, their lives would be gone, and humanity would lose an extremely powerful cruiser.</p><p></p><p>So they couldn't afford to gamble.</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxing was a very special cruiser with powerful signal shielding capabilities. It was humanity's current most advanced 'stealth ship', specially used for patrol missions in the outer regions.</p><p></p><p>In theory, the Eight-Armed Clan's 'Signal Hive' should not have been able to detect them. But after this raid on the Eight-Armed supply station, they detected an abnormal signal.</p><p></p><p>This was no ordinary matter.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a logistics officer stood up and said, "Reporting to the captain, we just received news that there was a problem with the batch of seized energy blocks."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was startled and looked towards the logistics officer.</p><p></p><p>The logistics officer's confirmation meant that the original 50% possibility had become 100% - in other words, the Yuanxing had indeed been locked onto by the Eight-Armed Clan's 'Signal Hive'.</p><p></p><p>The logistics officer continued, "The Eight-Armed at the supply station knew our target was the energy blocks. Before being annihilated, they planted a 'signal transmitter' in one of the energy blocks and disguised it extremely perfectly. Our soldiers brought it onto the ship, bypassing the self-check detectors."</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed were very clever. They knew that the more signal transmitters were placed, the greater the chance of exposure. So they only placed one, disguised it well, and indeed evaded inspection.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The captain's face showed anger as he slammed his fist on the table in front of him and roared, "Damn it! Meng Zhou and your logistics team have done a great job! How many times have I told you to use your eyeballs to carefully inspect everything brought onto the ship! If there's the slightest mistake, everyone on this ship will accompany you in death! Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The logistics officer named Meng Zhou looked extremely unsightly and lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, he might not have the face to stay on the Yuanxing anymore.</p><p></p><p>Scolding wouldn't solve the problem. The captain quickly regained his composure. "Immediately initiate the preset plan. Try to crack the signal frequency, release interference, and then disguise the signal transmitter before shooting it far away. At the same time, launch ten inflatable boats to mislead the Signal Hive's lock..."</p><p></p><p>Although there was a contingency plan, everyone clearly understood that once locked onto by the Signal Hive, it would be very difficult for them to break away from being tracked.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that the Eight-Armed Clan's Signal Hives were distributed throughout the entire Cloud Ring Star System. In this vast star system, there were not many places for them to evade detection...</p><p></p><p>Someone asked, "Can we return to Blue Light? Where do we go next?"</p><p></p><p>The captain took a deep breath, calmed his emotions, and said, "We can't go back! If there are no accidents, we may never be able to return in the future. Once discovered by the Eight-Armed Clan, we can only wander in space."</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent, knowing the captain was right. If they returned now, there was a high probability of exposing the location of humanity's homeworld 'Blue Light'.</p><p></p><p>That was humanity's last hope!</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, the captain said, "We're going to the Star Devourer's domain. There, we have a glimmer of hope!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>The Star Devourers were the great enemy of all intelligent life. The Star Devourer's domain was a forbidden zone for humans, the Eight-Armed Clan, and the Compound Eye Clan.</p><p></p><p>They all understood the captain's meaning - to enter the Star Devourer's domain and use the blind spot in the Eight-Armed's vision there to break away from the Signal Hive's lock and re-cloak themselves.</p><p></p><p>In the end, everyone voted in support of the captain's decision.</p><p></p><p>After the meeting, the captain personally sent an audio message to 'Blue Light': "Yuanxing suspected of exposure, terminating return journey."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Ever since this meeting ended, the atmosphere on the Yuanxing had changed. The previous joy of obtaining enough energy quickly disappeared, returning to the previous high state of alert.</p><p></p><p>Even Su Hao, just a regular soldier, could sense the oppressive atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>However, what put his mind at ease was that the battle he was worried about did not come so quickly!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, the vastness of space was too great. Even if they discovered each other, without special mobility means, it was not a simple matter to attack the target.</p><p></p><p>Twenty days later, Su Hao opened his eyes, got up and moved his body, feeling the surging blood energy within. He thought, "This body is indeed strong enough, perhaps related to the 'enhancer' Captain Yan mentioned!</p><p></p><p>With Su Hao's current enormous blood energy, he was confident he could take on armored soldiers without being at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>After all, he could now use blood energy to activate various runes, and the armor's defenses might not be able to withstand the effects of his 'piercing', 'shockwave', and other runes.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao entered the bullet space and activated the 'gene modification liquid' cultivation plan he had designed earlier.</p><p></p><p>Successful cultivation was estimated to take ten hours.</p><p></p><p>"First, I'll go to the cafeteria for a supplement. Recently, the cafeteria staff have started to take issue with me. If it weren't for my 'hero' halo, they probably wouldn't let me eat so much."</p>

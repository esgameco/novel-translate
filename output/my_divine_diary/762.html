        <h1>Chapter 762</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The current research on Yashān can be said to have reached the final stage, just one step away from success.</p><p></p><p>Suhao also took over Yashān's research results and participated in it, working together with Yashān to complete the final step.</p><p></p><p>However, things involving the level of biological consciousness are not simple.</p><p></p><p>Once the two immersed themselves in it, time flew by rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Before they knew it, another fifty years had passed.</p><p></p><p>It was during these fifty years that Suhao and Yashān's research on the spiritual external brain was truly completed.</p><p></p><p>What they did not expect was that this final stage took them fifty years.</p><p></p><p>But it was all worth it.</p><p></p><p>Yashān sighed: "A tiny nerve cell is so unique. The difference between the spiritual external brain and the neural module is just this simple thing called 'real-time feedback'."</p><p></p><p>"It was just this little thing called the 'kinetic spirit particle' that took us a full fifty years to completely discover."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Don't underestimate this little thing. If we weren't lucky, we might not have been able to discover its new use."</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'kinetic spirit particle' is Suhao's nickname for a type of electron that can freely move within the spiritual external brain. It is precisely because of these electrons that can freely move within the spiritual external brain that the entire spiritual external brain becomes vibrant, not just a 'computer' with super high computing power.</p><p></p><p>Under the effect of the 'kinetic spirit particles', the entire spiritual external brain is in a state of 'motion-feedback-satisfaction-recording' at every moment, like a true life form, coming alive.</p><p></p><p>It is in this state that the spiritual external brain, when connected to the brain, provides Suhao with tremendous computing power like the Mother Bug neural module, while also enhancing consciousness information and gaining the special ability 'mini-self'.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the spiritual external brain is no worse than the Mother Bug neural module.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, it has many advantages, such as smaller size, faster speed, easier manufacturing, and it can have all the functions of the 'consciousness platform', directly replacing it.</p><p></p><p>Yashān said: "Master Wei, now that the research on the spiritual external brain is complete, should we convert all the current neural external brains into spiritual external brains?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "Sure, you can go first!"</p><p></p><p>So Yashān obediently lay on the experiment table!</p><p></p><p>The replacement with the spiritual external brain went very smoothly. After a period of adaptation, the two quickly returned to their previous state, and even better than before.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Yashān, this task is now officially over. I'll give you a year off, and you can go to various places in the Cloud Ring System to have fun and relax for a while.</p><p></p><p>The expansion of humanity in the Cloud Ring System is now very rapid, so there should be a lot of interesting things. You can go around and experience life.</p><p></p><p>After a year, I'll assign you the next task."</p><p></p><p>Yashān smiled: "Okay, Master Wei, I was thinking of going out for a spin too. What about you, Master Wei? Won't you go out and experience the worldly splendor? After all, you've been in the second-level world for fifty years, so you should go out and experience the worldly atmosphere."</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head: "I tried it a long time ago. I don't fit in with that kind of 'splendor'. Compared to the hustle and bustle of low-level desires in the human world, I prefer a quieter environment."</p><p></p><p>Yashān sighed: "Indeed, most humans are currently in a state of being dominated by physical desires. Different environments and experiences lead to different cognitions, with varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>When dealing with things, they like to evaluate from the standpoint of their own absolute advantage, seeking profit!</p><p></p><p>However, as Master Wei said, there is no need to participate in such low-level splendor."</p><p></p><p>At Suhao's current level, it is difficult to find people in human society with whom he can communicate normally.</p><p></p><p>It's not that the complex thoughts in human society are bad; on the contrary, it is precisely in such a noisy environment that society can progress.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Suhao's perspective on looking at problems is different from ordinary people!</p><p></p><p>This difference in perspective makes Suhao not even have the desire to communicate with others, let alone participate in human society and interact with humans.</p><p></p><p>Now, the only ones who can communicate with him normally are probably just technicians, exchanging technical information...</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed: "It has nothing to do with high or low levels. Humans are essentially a social animal. Because humans need to cooperate with each other to complete tasks that independent individuals cannot accomplish, in order to obtain better survival."</p><p></p><p>"Look at me, what tasks do I need to complete that require group cooperation?"</p><p></p><p>Yashān vowed solemnly: "That's not true, Master Wei. Fengcheng and I can still cooperate and communicate with you! And don't worry, Master Wei, I will definitely be able to keep up with your pace and be of help."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "Indeed, it's good that you and Fengcheng are here, otherwise I wouldn't have anyone to talk to."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he said slowly: "If in the future I become extremely powerful and can completely control my own destiny, I hope this silent and gloomy universe becomes more lively, with more powerful people who share the same pursuit and spiritual realm."</p><p></p><p>Yashān didn't understand what Suhao meant by 'lively', but he also realized that this universe is indeed too gloomy.</p><p></p><p>After reincarnating through so many worlds, they haven't encountered any 'space wanderers' like the three of them.</p><p></p><p>The humans and Eight-Armed Race he has seen in this world are already the strongest civilizations capable of leaving their planets.</p><p></p><p>Although he doesn't understand what 'lively' means, he has remembered: "Master Wei hopes that after completely mastering his own destiny, he will make the universe more lively."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Yashān left, Suhao sat alone in the pavilion of the second-level world, pondering his own issues.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he has indeed become more reclusive. He enjoys tranquility, but he doesn't like being alone until the end of time.</p><p></p><p>The last five hundred years of his previous life were spent alone.</p><p></p><p>Around him, he sensed an entire star domain devoid of any signs of life, everything utterly silent.</p><p></p><p>The stars were raging but slowly releasing light and heat, the planets rotating year after year, spinning day after day.</p><p></p><p>A dead silence.</p><p></p><p>After that, Suhao knew that he didn't really enjoy solitude.</p><p></p><p>Even if he doesn't interact with people, he hopes there is a sense of life around him.</p><p></p><p>If there were some people he could communicate and play with, that would be even better.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought: "In the distant future, is there a possibility that I will encounter a group of space wanderers like myself, roaming the starry sky of the universe, searching for the wonders hidden in the depths of the cosmos?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if there are, I probably won't be able to see them. After all, my vision is still too narrow, and I can't see farther away. I'm still too weak."</p><p></p><p>"If there are no such space wanderers...when I gain absolute freedom and control my own destiny, I will usher in an era of space wanderers!"</p><p></p><p>"Make this silent universe come alive. Together we will seek more knowledge, exchange our surprising discoveries with each other, and marvel at each other's achievements..."</p><p></p><p>As he thought about it, Suhao was filled with longing for that 'distant future'.</p><p></p><p>He even couldn't wait to see such a scene.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, Suhao put away his thoughts and once again controlled the Eight-Armed God to enter the laboratory.</p><p></p><p>He knew that no matter how wonderful the future is, no matter how much he looks forward to the future, everything starts from the present.</p><p></p><p>By doing well with the current tasks, a wonderful future may be realized.</p><p></p><p>In the laboratory, Suhao created several spiritual brains, then entered the Billiard Space and retrieved the consciousness information of several prisoners previously recorded in the Billiard Space.</p><p></p><p>"Next, try implanting human consciousness information into the spiritual brain to see if it can support human consciousness thinking.</p><p></p><p>If it works, that means I can try to find a way for consciousness to break free from the constraints of the brain.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in this world, I can gain the eternity I desire."</p>

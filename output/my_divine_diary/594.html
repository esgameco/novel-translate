        <h1>Chapter 594</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The allied forces were annihilated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Apart from less than a thousand people who were deliberately allowed to survive by Su Hao and the other two, everyone else lay on the ground, turned into cold corpses.</p><p></p><p>The speed of annihilation was so fast that everyone failed to react.</p><p></p><p>This was reflected in Zhi Peng's experience:</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, a second messenger ran in from outside: "Report, Brother Zhi Peng, a huge roaring sound has come from the direction of the allied forces' army corps, suspected to be from a battle."</p><p></p><p>Before Zhi Peng could react, a third messenger ran in: "Report, Brother Zhi Peng, it has been confirmed that the ten major allied army corps have been annihilated, almost the entire army has been wiped out."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng: "......"</p><p></p><p>Not only was Zhi Peng dumbfounded, but even the extremely intelligent level-five friends attending the staff meeting were also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What the heck, how could the battle reports be so chaotic?</p><p></p><p>Those allied mages who had miraculously survived were now panic-stricken and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Most of them stood dazed, looking at the large swath of fallen comrades, unable to comprehend what had happened in the first moment.</p><p></p><p>"We were just attacked? And... completely annihilated?"</p><p></p><p>This was simply unthinkable!</p><p></p><p>"I'm so freakishly awesome!"</p><p></p><p>The allied forces' rear command post.</p><p></p><p>"Have the ten army corps not been contacted yet?"</p><p></p><p>Allied regulations required contact with the rear command post every five minutes, but now fifteen minutes had passed without any news from the front line, giving the personnel at the rear command an ominous feeling.</p><p></p><p>"The fastest mages were dispatched to investigate as soon as contact was lost. We'll have definitive information in ten more minutes."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps there was some problem and the army corps' communication equipment was damaged!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait for the results."</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, sure enough, the first mage returned to report.</p><p></p><p>"What? The fourth army corps has been completely annihilated? Are you joking with us?"</p><p></p><p>The scout, his face full of horror, said, "Every word I speak is what I saw with my own eyes, it is no lie."</p><p></p><p>Soon, more than twenty scouts who had been sent out returned one after another, all reporting complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, apart from the less than a thousand survivors who slipped through the net, in everyone's eyes it was no different from complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>The command post personnel still could not believe it was true.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go see for ourselves. If these scouts have lied, they will be dealt with under martial law."</p><p></p><p>Soon after, they arrived at the scene of the army corps' annihilation.</p><p></p><p>The sight could only be described in two words - horrific!</p><p></p><p>The overall commander of this operation suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, tilted his head back and fell down: "It's all over!"</p><p></p><p>However, the emperors of the various districts in New Era City were still singing and dancing, celebrating the victory of the war.</p><p></p><p>In their view, since the army corps had set out, the war was already won.</p><p></p><p>They just had to wait quietly for the news.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Ah Shan and Feng Cheng were doing the cleanup work, while Su Hao directly transmitted back to the base small world.</p><p></p><p>The moment he returned to the base small world, his divine sense perceived more than thirty source mages thirty kilometers away.</p><p></p><p>Shifting his attention to them, he saw them floundering in the water, swimming outward in four directions.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Aren't these the little fellows who found the Gourd Dao before? Why have they come again!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing their situation, Su Hao pondered briefly and guessed the gist of what had happened.</p><p></p><p>This piqued Su Hao's great interest.</p><p></p><p>Being able to accurately locate his hidden island twice in a row was certainly no coincidence - the other party must truly have a way to pinpoint the location of the base.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the small island at this timing, they were obviously taking advantage of the allied forces' attack to try to sneak in and steal.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, these few people were really bold.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not know that within a thirty-kilometer radius of Su Hao's base small world, he had set up an optimized suppressor that would instantly deprive any source mage entering the area of their source abilities.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, these people had recklessly entered the suppression range and fallen straight into the sea.</p><p></p><p>"Are they trying to find the right direction to exit the suppression range? I have to admit, they do have a bit of cleverness. But if I expand the suppressor's range to two hundred kilometers now, I wonder what they'll do?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao casually modified the suppressor, expanding its effective range to the initial version, covering a two-hundred-kilometer radius around him.</p><p></p><p>Since the other party had managed to locate his dwelling place twice in a row and still wanted to steal from him, he would let them soak in the sea for a while longer as a minor punishment from Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Once they had soaked enough, he would fish them out, figure out how they found the small island, and then hand them over to Ah Shan for experiments and data collection.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Fei Diao and his four teammates swam outward for over two hundred meters, but none of them regained their abilities, so they floundered back, gasping for breath.</p><p></p><p>Although physically strong, swimming was not their forte after all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that none of the four had regained their abilities, Fei Diao looked incredulous: "How is this possible? Could it be the effect of ocean currents? No, that can't be right! I observed the currents carefully before the operation, their influence definitely shouldn't be that great. Could my calculations be wrong?"</p><p></p><p>He recalculated, but no matter how he figured it, it didn't add up.</p><p></p><p>Comparing the distances his teammates had swum, theoretically at least one of them should have exited the source suppression area in any given direction.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head vigorously: "Something's not right, something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Li, gasping for breath, asked, "Fei Diao, what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>Fei Diao took a deep breath, bobbing gently with the waves: "Let me think, there has to be a way."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Fei Diao asked the wind source mage A Cai, "A Cai, did your abilities suddenly fail just now?"</p><p></p><p>A Cai nodded: "It was fine before, then suddenly became uncontrollable."</p><p></p><p>Fei Diao asked, "Do you all still have strength left? We must exit this source suppression area as soon as possible, otherwise the cold seawater will quickly cause our body temperatures to drop, and we'll freeze to death in the sea."</p><p></p><p>The four of them all nodded: "We can do it, just tell us what to do, Fei Diao!"</p><p></p><p>Fei Diao said firmly, "Let's swim again, this time swim four hundred meters in one go!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The four didn't hesitate, turning to swim outward again, while Fei Diao remained in place, thinking quietly, his teeth clenched.</p><p></p><p>His teammates trusted him so much, he had to lead everyone out safely.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the four teammates swam back, each gasping for breath, floating on the surface unwilling to move again.</p><p></p><p>But Fei Diao was completely dumbstruck, muttering, "Unbelievable... we still didn't swim out. Could it be... the suppression area is irregular? Or perhaps, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom?</p><p></p><p>No... that shouldn't be the case, areas like this are 99% likely to be regular spheres. Then what on earth is going on?"</p><p></p><p>He listed out all the possible scenarios one by one, then eliminated them successively, leaving three possibilities: one was that the suppression area was an irregular cone shape, with the surface suppression range much larger than they had imagined, but the aerial range much smaller;</p><p></p><p>The second was that as soon as they approached the small island, they were detected by the 'Peel-the-Earth Armor', which then lured them in and suddenly activated its suppression ability, trapping them in the sea;</p><p></p><p>The third was...</p><p></p><p>No matter which one it was, for them it was a dead end!</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, seeing his teammates starting to shiver from the cold, he thought inwardly, "The first possibility is relatively lower than the second and third, so I'll choose to believe that we've been detected by the Peel-the-Earth Armor."</p><p></p><p>He exhaled deeply and said, "Xiang Li, let's surrender!"</p><p></p><p>"Surrender???"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao sensed an anomaly in his divine sense, shifting his attention to Fei Diao and the others, he saw them all raising their hands above the sea surface in a surrendering gesture, while shouting something in unison.</p><p></p><p>Too far away, Su Hao couldn't hear it, but he could analyze their lip movements and sound waves to deduce the corresponding words.</p><p></p><p>"Mage, spare our lives! We unconditionally surrender!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao raised his eyebrows: "They can actually surrender?"</p><p></p><p>But since the other party had surrendered, he might as well accept their surrender.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao flashed into appearance above Fei Diao and the others, looking down at them, and indeed heard their voices calling out loudly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the figure of a crystal armored person appear in midair, Fei Diao flashed with excitement and shouted loudly, "Mage! We had no ill intentions, if we have offended you unintentionally, we deeply apologize! We now unconditionally surrender, to be dealt with as you see fit, please spare our lives!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed lightly, "Unintentional offense? It doesn't matter, since you've surrendered."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Su Hao cast a 'Balancing Technique' on each of them, transmitting them back into the small world, casually tossing them into the newly developed 'Experimental Subject Living Area'.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Fei Diao saw his godfather La Da.</p><p></p><p>The two teams of ten people stared at each other wide-eyed.</p>

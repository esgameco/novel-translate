        <h1>Chapter 682</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The stretching and bending of space was not unfamiliar to Su Hao, on the contrary, he had seen it many times.</p><p></p><p>The space around any massive planet would be curved due to the influence of the planet's gravitational waves.</p><p></p><p>However, the spatial curvature he had observed before was a different concept from what he was observing now.</p><p></p><p>Previously, his perceptive ability was very limited, only within a range of 200,000 meters, which was negligible compared to the size of an entire planet.</p><p></p><p>It was like observing a leopard through a pipe, only seeing one spot.</p><p></p><p>He was fundamentally unable to see the full picture of how a planet curved space.</p><p></p><p>For his tiny existence, the space at every location seemed no different.</p><p></p><p>Now, the space around the spacecraft he was observing was no longer just a small point in the curved space, but rather the entire picture!</p><p></p><p>This feeling was quite peculiar, as if an ant had finally seen the appearance of an entire tree.</p><p></p><p>This made him extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>He wholeheartedly marveled: "I've seen different sceneries in the universe again, it's truly wonderful! I hope every journey of mine will yield some gains."</p><p></p><p>However, seeing did not mean he could understand the principle of spatial curvature and utilize that principle to do something.</p><p></p><p>He felt he still had a long way to go!</p><p></p><p>After all, using the spatial module for 'teleportation' and using the stretching and contraction of space for propulsion, although both involved spatial factors, were strictly speaking two different subjects.</p><p></p><p>The two would provide great reference value, allowing him to learn and understand the principles at an extremely fast pace.</p><p></p><p>But he still needed to study! Not studying was absolutely impossible.</p><p></p><p>Just like before he had seen the 'small world', he could not understand its structure.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao pondered randomly, he observed the full picture of spatial stretching and contraction with full effort, recording the changes in the spatial modules perceived by his spiritual tentacles.</p><p></p><p>But gradually, as the spacecraft's speed became faster and faster, his perception was severely disrupted, and in the end he could not even see the full picture of space clearly.</p><p></p><p>Only within the range of the spacecraft could normal perception be maintained, while the outside was a blur.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, I can't see it anymore!"</p><p></p><p>As time passed second by second, when the spatial gap reached a certain level, it no longer changed and gradually stabilized.</p><p></p><p>The spatial pressure weighing on every cell also slowly weakened and eventually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a broadcast came from the 'adaptation chamber': "The curvature engine has been successfully activated, all personnel may leave the 'adaptation chamber' and move freely."</p><p></p><p>"Woah!"</p><p></p><p>The chamber doors opened one after another, and the entire adaptation chamber became lively, with everyone vehemently discussing the current state of the spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from their pale faces and trembling bodies trying to appear calm, the spatial pressure just now was clearly not pleasant, yet they were unwilling to admit defeat in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Every time the engine is activated, I get so excited that my whole body trembles. Don't look at my withered appearance now, that's because I was bored just now, suppressed."</p><p></p><p>"You can't even walk steadily, yet you're still talking big! Look at me, I can still run, let me ask you, am I awesome or not?"</p><p></p><p>"Being able to run is nothing, I can even do a handstand!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not like you guys who love to brag, I'm really dizzy, let me rest for a bit!"</p><p></p><p>As they chatted, suddenly someone noticed Su Hao, who had a normal complexion and was walking out slowly: "Hey? Don't you see, isn't that the eye-popping divine marksman Xu Shiqiang? How come he looks like nothing happened!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, it really is him! How did he do it? This is the engine acceleration!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he's a hero, even his leaving back view looks so cool. If he were a woman, I would definitely fall for him."</p><p></p><p>"Please don't fall for him."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a hero, I knew long ago that he's different from others."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After leaving the adaptation chamber, Su Hao curiously walked around the spacecraft, trying to use his radar to sense things outside the spacecraft, but all attempts failed. The 'spiritual waves' he emitted seemed to be devoured by something unknown after leaving the spacecraft, disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the current speed of the spacecraft has exceeded the speed of light..."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the previous life when he piloted the 'Initial Ship' and wandered slowly in the universe...</p><p></p><p>It really lived up to the saying: without comparison, there is no harm.</p><p></p><p>As he walked back to the dormitory, he made a firm resolution: "I must master the curvature engine technology!"</p><p></p><p>But before truly entering a state of study, he still needed to make some preparations, to regain all the powers from his previous life, and eliminate any worries!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, he suddenly had a brilliant idea: "Observe the location of the curvature engine, and once my blood energy is strong enough, gradually record the engine into the ball space! That way, even if I'm suddenly reborn, I can still study it in the future."</p><p></p><p>After returning to the dormitory, he set up defensive formations to avoid disturbances, and immediately entered the small world to continue cultivating, striving to recover his strongest spiritual power as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly.</p><p></p><p>Before he knew it, a year had passed.</p><p></p><p>And Su Hao had also recovered his ideal strongest state.</p><p></p><p>Level 7 'Command Child', 'Seer' and a series of other pendants loaded, a deity-realm cultivator, maximum spiritual power, maximum spatial ability, maximum perception, bursting blood energy, sufficient 'source' reserves...</p><p></p><p>In this state, he was comparable to his peak in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>However, there were still some things that had not manifested, such as the 'Seeker Ring', the 'Spiritual Eye', the 'Planet Virus', and most crucially, the 'Divine'.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that on the Yuoxing Ship, the corresponding conditions were lacking.</p><p></p><p>The 'Seeker Ring', 'Spiritual Eye', and 'Planet Virus' required corresponding processing machinery as aids, and even he could not directly create them by hand at the moment.</p><p></p><p>His plan was to customize a multi-functional manufacturing and processing plant after returning to the Blue Light, and then place it in a portable small world.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he could manufacture various objects anytime, anywhere.</p><p></p><p>As for the 'Divine', he could create it from his own cells, but after experiencing attempts in the previous world, he found that the 'Divine' created from his own cells had major defects in both the neural system and physical body, which would cause some sluggishness in control, resulting in a poor holographic control experience.</p><p></p><p>So he decided to evolve the 'Divine' from other lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao walked out of the small world in the dormitory, feeling a sense of security permeating everywhere in his body, revealing a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>This was the feeling he wanted, full of strength and vitality!</p><p></p><p>Although he could use the crew on the spacecraft as the physical body for the 'Divine', Su Hao did not want to do that.</p><p></p><p>"First, let me get the engine! I just don't know if my blood energy can successfully record the engine while it's activated."</p><p></p><p>After getting dressed, he walked slowly towards the rear section near the engine.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, officer!"</p><p></p><p>"Long time no see, officer!"</p><p></p><p>All the crew members he encountered along the way saluted and greeted him proactively, looking at him with great curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Hao's official promotion order had not been issued, in the eyes of these crew members, his status was equivalent to an officer, and they addressed him as 'officer' very naturally.</p><p></p><p>The reason they were so curious about his appearance was that he had not come out of the dormitory for a long time, and very few people would disturb him.</p><p></p><p>He had become the most special crew member on this spacecraft: no need for training, no need for study, no need to write reports, and even no need to eat...</p><p></p><p>Even the logistics crew in the cafeteria rarely saw Su Hao come to eat anymore, completely different from the 'food barrel' he used to be.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and returned the greetings. Soon, he stopped in front of a large storage room: "It's here!"</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes slightly, controlling his surging blood energy to spread towards the huge machinery not far away, which was suspected to be the 'engine'.</p><p></p><p>The massive machinery fixed at the rear end was ring-shaped, like a greatly enlarged bracelet, which might be the curvature engine that propelled the spacecraft forward.</p><p></p><p>The surface of this engine appeared motionless, but Su Hao knew it was in an activated state.</p><p></p><p>A strange humming sound faintly reached his spiritual perception.</p><p></p><p>The curvature engine was enormous, and although Su Hao's blood energy was vast, he still could not record it into the ball space all at once.</p><p></p><p>His strategy was to take it slow, recording a bit today and a bit tomorrow... Eventually, he would be able to record it completely.</p><p></p><p>The idea was perfect!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he soon realized it was not feasible.</p><p></p><p>Opening his eyes and retracting his scattered blood energy, he thought to himself: "My blood energy was dispersed by some unknown force after entering the engine. It seems I can't record it while the engine is activated... Oh well! I'm not in a hurry, I can wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only could Su Hao's blood energy not enter the interior of the engine, even his 'divine consciousness' could not perceive the situation inside the engine.</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao turned and slowly walked back, preparing to return to the rest area, he heard the voice from the spacecraft's broadcast: "In two hours, the spacecraft will shut down the curvature engine. All personnel should immediately enter the adaptation chamber and prepare."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but show a surprised expression: "I just said I'd wait a bit, and you're stopping already? That's perfect timing."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know how far the spacecraft has traveled in this past year!"</p>

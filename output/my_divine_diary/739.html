        <h1>Chapter 739</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>As humans continued to expand outwards, the disadvantage of insufficient population immediately became apparent. Even if all the humans on the blue planet were scattered across the various colonial planets, it still might not be enough...</p><p></p><p>So the human side rolled out countless policies related to reproduction, encouraging childbirth. Unfortunately, the effect was not as good as imagined, as people's enthusiasm for reproduction was not high.</p><p></p><p>Then a brilliant person came up with an idea: list BY sets and BY drugs as prohibited items, completely removing these two products from the shelves and shutting down all related industries. At the same time, crack down heavily on anyone who dared to still sell such things, with a minimum sentence of ten years!</p><p></p><p>Later, there were also cases of people going to hospitals for abortions. Then another brilliant person came up with a new idea: unless the fetus is detected as defective, abortion is prohibited. Violators will be charged with murder.</p><p></p><p>This is how ordinary people had their ordinary ways, while the human leadership came up with all kinds of strange strategies by thinking outside the box.</p><p></p><p>The two sides battled it out, competing with techniques...</p><p></p><p>In the end, ordinary people were completely defeated.</p><p></p><p>Many people no longer wanted to have children, but could not control their animal desires, accidentally creating new lives.</p><p></p><p>Many parents looked at the seven or eight children following behind them, wanting to cry but having no tears left.</p><p></p><p>They really did not want to have any more children...but unfortunately there were some things on their bodies that they could not control.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they could only lie flat: do whatever, give birth but not raise them.</p><p></p><p>They were even too lazy to care whether the children born were really theirs or not.</p><p></p><p>After all, many men knew clearly that some of their children were being helped raised by others, and conversely, they were helping strangers raise children too, which was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this exactly what "let the world be filled with love" meant? Mutual understanding, a world in harmony.</p><p></p><p>As for the Octopus Clan, after ten years of repeated probing and experimentation, they reached a conclusion: humans were invincible, they could not be defeated.</p><p></p><p>This conclusion dealt a huge blow to the Octopus Clan, they simply could not believe it was true.</p><p></p><p>It was like the monkeys who were used to being the boss in the zoo suddenly finding out one day that two tigers had come, and from then on the zoo was no longer a place where they monkeys called the shots.</p><p></p><p>The monkeys could hardly believe it: "How could there be tigers in the zoo? How could the zoo allow tigers in? Where does that leave us orthodox monkeys?"</p><p></p><p>In this situation, the previously very stable social structure of the Octopus Clan inevitably became turbulent.</p><p></p><p>But the Octopus Clan still firmly believed that they were the orthodox ones, and would eventually be able to annihilate the humans and achieve the great unification of the Cloud Ring System again.</p><p></p><p>This line of thinking was indeed correct, because currently humans were unable to reach most of the star domains in the Cloud Ring System, which were still under the rule of the Octopus Clan.</p><p></p><p>They had sufficient resources and time to study ways to counter humans.</p><p></p><p>As for the Compound Eye Race...</p><p></p><p>The Compound Eye Race was the most conflicted race.</p><p></p><p>They hoped humans could counter the Octopus Clan, but did not want humans to defeat the Octopus Clan.</p><p></p><p>The best result for them would be for humans and the Octopus Clan to endlessly battle and damage each other over a long period of time, until they were both exhausted. Then the Compound Eye Race would become the final winner, looking down upon the entire Cloud Ring System...</p><p></p><p>The current situation of humans hanging the Octopus Clan up and beating them was obviously not the scenario they wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>So some members of the Compound Eye Race started having different thoughts: "Should we secretly obtain humans' various advanced technologies and pass them to the Octopus Clan to try?"</p><p></p><p>Although they were currently on the same side as humans, no one could say for sure what would happen in the future.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>During these ten years, many things happened for humans, the Octopus Clan and the Compound Eye Race.</p><p></p><p>But for Su Hao, it was just the completion of a slightly more complicated "automatic consciousness information matching mechanism", as if not much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>Time was becoming increasingly worthless in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that his parents in this life had passed away years ago, and his younger sister and brother-in-law were already quite elderly, looking like they would return to dust before too long.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao met his sister Xu Ruyun at their parents' funeral, she cried and begged Su Hao to help take care of her daughter Hua Yonghua in the future.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had witnessed death and parting many times, but every time he encountered such things, there was always some inexplicable feeling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was not sadness over his parents' passing, but a lamentation over a consciousness falling into eternal oblivion.</p><p></p><p>And Yonghua, because of her brilliant mind and extensive knowledge, successfully joined the top human research institute and became the chief researcher in the field of "energy weapons".</p><p></p><p>With Xia Qingjun's vigorous promotion, she became the national science goddess, gaining recognition from all of humanity, happily being called "Miss Yonghua".</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Yonghua also became one of only two people who could freely enter and exit Su Hao's research miniverse.</p><p></p><p>Many problems encountered in human scientific research were resolved by Yonghua entering the miniverse to consult Ya Shan.</p><p></p><p>This elevated "Miss Yonghua's" status to an extremely high level, with a sense that only the human leader Xia Qingjun was above her.</p><p></p><p>One day, Yonghua entered the miniverse to ask Ya Shan a question about the "planet destroyer cannon", but did not see Ya Shan, instead encountering Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng confidently patted his chest and said, "Yonghua, if you have any questions, just ask me! Don't think I'm bragging, but I have deeply mastered the true teachings of Master Wei and Master Ya Shan. Your questions can be easily solved by me."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua didn't believe him: "I asked you a few times before and you couldn't solve many of them, right?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "How can you look at me through the lens of ten years ago?"</p><p></p><p>He showed his forehead and said, "You may not know what kind of storm of thought this brain of mine has gone through. Let me put it this way, my growth in these ten years has completely crushed everyone in your research institute!"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua was no longer the easily fooled little girl she used to be, she just rolled her eyes at Feng Cheng: "Brother Feng Cheng, my brain is working well now! This kind of full-of-holes reasoning can't fool me."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng put his forehead away and waved his big hand: "You ask! If I can't answer, I'll teach you a magic spell."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua's eyes lit up: "Really?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled confidently: "Ask!"</p><p></p><p>Then Feng Cheng really did solve Yonghua's question in just a few moments, and also provided other supporting solutions, with various formulas and data listed neatly.</p><p></p><p>Yonghua was completely shocked, looking at Feng Cheng the same way she looked at Su Hao and Ya Shan, full of admiration: "Brother Feng Cheng, you're so awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed loudly and showed his forehead: "Look at this bright forehead, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua: "I'm so envious, if only I could be as awesome as you guys."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said proudly, "It's mainly because the two masters are awesome. You keep studying hard, Yonghua, and one day you'll catch up to me. Oh, if you can't find Master Ya Shan in the future, you can come to me, it's the same."</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm still working hard to catch up to Master Ya Shan's pace, and there's still quite a gap between us, even so, I'm not someone you all can easily handle."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Feng Cheng finally experienced the pleasure that Ya Shan felt when saying the same words to him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not long after Yonghua left, Su Hao suddenly appeared beside Feng Cheng and asked, "Feng Cheng, what happened that made you so happy?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng exclaimed happily, "Master Wei, you've finally come out of seclusion! My brain has become smarter now, so I'm happy! It turns out having super high intelligence is such a happy thing."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "That's not necessarily true. I've seen many people with extremely high IQs who easily saw through the essence of life, and developed higher, more perfect expectations for life and living.</p><p></p><p>But because reality can never meet their perfect expectations, they fell into long periods of depression.</p><p></p><p>So intelligence and happiness cannot be simply equated.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, what you're feeling should be the happiness from perceiving your own progress."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled: "That's exactly it. Before, I could never solve Yonghua's questions. But now I can easily break them down, comb through them clearly, find the key points, and solve them with very simple methods.</p><p></p><p>I feel my tremendous progress, and an inexplicable joy arises in my heart. This kind of joy is stronger than wandering the Melody Immortal Palace by at least ten thousand times!</p><p></p><p>Haha, Master Wei, I have a feeling I'm going to become a research maniac!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ya Shan also appeared. Feng Cheng's eyes lit up and he immediately showed Ya Shan his self-evaluation: "Master Ya Shan, I'm already a junior researcher, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan obliged him with a slight look of surprise: "Oh, you're quite capable, it seems!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course I'm capable, I learned from you two masters!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Since you're both here, I'll go ahead and tell you about my plans going forward.</p><p></p><p>I've preliminarily completed the first phase of my research plan, and I'm going to spend some time on the Compound Eye Race's home planet to study their characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan, you focus on researching how to build an 'external brain' using spiritual power, and strive to replace the Mother Insect's 'neural organization'. If we can accomplish this, then we won't have wasted this life.</p><p></p><p>As for you, Feng Cheng, your foundation is a bit weaker, so your focus going forward will be studying.</p><p></p><p>Read more books, and try to go through all the materials recorded in your assistant, absorbing useful knowledge and integrating it thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, research the insect eggs and try to analyze the Mother Insect's egg development mechanism. See if you can directly transform the eggs using the Source.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate goal of this research is to create a [Divine Egg] that can directly hatch into a [Divine] being."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Master Wei!"</p>

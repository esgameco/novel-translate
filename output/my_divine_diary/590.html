        <h1>Chapter 590</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The largest and most prosperous city in the world, New Era City.</p><p></p><p>In the top conference hall of 'Hechu', the world headquarters of the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>It was grand, imposing, magnificent and more luxurious than any palace.</p><p></p><p>At this time, of the nineteen prestigious round table seats, only eighteen were occupied, excluding the white-haired old man sitting in the top position, whose honorific title was 'Harmony Mage', the highest leader of the Mage Association. The remaining seventeen people were emperors of various regions, both men and women.</p><p></p><p>The 'Emperor He' of the Horizontal Region was absent. The reason for his absence did not need further explanation, as everyone present was well aware of it. It was also the reason for convening this '127th Joint Conference of the Eighteen Imperial Nations'.</p><p></p><p>On the desk in front of each person was a thick stack of documents.</p><p></p><p>It included the beginning of the incident, an introduction to the Radiant Society, information on the Armor of Stripping the Earth, as well as the 'declaration of war' recently issued by the Radiant Society.</p><p></p><p>These documents had been read before attending the meeting. After a brief review to ensure nothing was missed, no one paid much further attention to the information in the documents.</p><p></p><p>Their main purpose in attending this meeting was only one thing: how to resolve the problem.</p><p></p><p>After the royal family of the Horizontal Region was wiped out overnight, these emperors felt a sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>However, this sense of crisis did not stem from the Radiant Society itself, but rather from the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>Even though the royal family of the Horizontal Region was completely annihilated overnight, in the eyes of these emperors, the Emperor He of the Horizontal Region was too weak and unworthy of being called an emperor alongside them.</p><p></p><p>In their view, the Radiant Society was merely a slightly larger cockroach, nothing to be afraid of.</p><p></p><p>What they were concerned about was the attitude of the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>All the royal families knew that within the Mage Association, the call to 'amend the last clause of the agreement' was growing louder. They were worried that the Mage Association would seize this opportunity to directly abolish the clause 'maintaining the legitimate rule of the imperial nations'.</p><p></p><p>If that happened, the royal families who lost the protection of the Mage Association would truly face destruction.</p><p></p><p>Harmony Mage looked to be at least sixty years old, but his face still appeared vibrant and lively, showing no trace of the usual weariness of old age.</p><p></p><p>He opened with a smile, "I believe the emperors are already aware of the origins of this matter. I have temporarily summoned you emperors here to understand your perspectives and potential solutions."</p><p></p><p>Harmony Mage's expression was gentle, with a benevolent smile, but the emperors clearly sensed a detached feeling from his tone.</p><p></p><p>The emperors exchanged glances, and a middle-aged man sitting in the 7th counterclockwise position slowly stood up and said, "This is an inhumane massacre, and the Radiant Society is the most evil organization in the world, devoid of any humanity. Faced with such evil, we should unite our stance, gather our strength, and resolutely eliminate them."</p><p></p><p>This middle-aged man, dressed in a purple robe with a phoenix eye and long beard, appeared righteous and just, as if his every word and action represented justice in the world.</p><p></p><p>This was the Emperor Cloud of the Dragon Heart Region.</p><p></p><p>Harmony Mage merely smiled and did not speak, as if waiting for others' opinions.</p><p></p><p>Then, an elderly man in the 10th position spoke up, "Emperor Cloud's words are not wrong. Such extreme evil in the world surpasses even major disasters and must be nipped in the bud as soon as possible to prevent further civilian casualties."</p><p></p><p>"If ordinary citizens suffer such massacres, how much more so for us, the esteemed royal families of the world? We must completely eradicate this evil organization and make it known to all, upholding the dignity of the royal families."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the dignity of our royal families must be upheld. This emperor proposes that while eliminating the evil organization, we also seek out the remaining bloodline of the Horizontal Region's royal family and support them in becoming the new emperor to maintain the legitimate imperial rule!"</p><p></p><p>The conference hall suddenly fell silent. All the emperors inwardly praised, "Who would have thought that the young Emperor Jia would voice our innermost thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, everyone expressed their agreement with Emperor Jia.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, although the main lineage of the 'Hengxuan Imperial Nation' has been severed, the royal bloodline will not be cut off. The Horizontal Region is still the Horizontal Region, and the royal family will not be destroyed because of this."</p><p></p><p>"We royal families are the foundation of peace in this world. To prevent the world from falling into endless war, leading to the suffering of the people, we must maintain the stability of the royal families."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Everyone stated various grand justifications one after another.</p><p></p><p>Harmony Mage listened quietly. After the emperors finished speaking, he said, "I now understand the opinions of the emperors. Since you all agree to gather forces for elimination, a plan for elimination needs to be proposed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, I will have to trouble the emperors to stay in New Era City for a few more days to discuss the details together. Please rest assured, emperors, that the Mage Association will uphold the legitimate rule of each imperial nation. As for finding the royal bloodline in the Horizontal Region and supporting the legitimate heir, the Mage Association will handle that.</p><p></p><p>As for eliminating the Radiant Society, I believe with the strength of the emperors, it can be easily accomplished. Of course, if the association can provide any assistance, we will not decline.</p><p></p><p>There is also one piece of information that needs to be mentioned here. It seems the Radiant Society has mastered a method to restrain mages' abilities. Please be cautious in dealing with this, and do not be careless."</p><p></p><p>After Harmony Mage finished speaking, the emperors understood the Mage Association's stance on this matter: The Mage Association would uphold the legitimate imperial rule, but if the Radiant Society came looking for trouble, the emperors would have to find a way to resolve it themselves. The association could provide assistance but would not help them quell the unrest.</p><p></p><p>However, this was acceptable. As long as the Mage Association continued to uphold the legitimate imperial rule, all problems were not problems.</p><p></p><p>The Radiant Society has mastered a method to restrain mages' abilities?</p><p></p><p>They believed that as long as there were difficulties, the solution would not be far away.</p><p></p><p>It had always been this way, and this time would be no exception.</p><p></p><p>After a few days of discussion, the subordinates of the seventeen emperors quickly proposed a response plan.</p><p></p><p>The seventeen regions would contribute personnel and resources to form a joint military force of the seventeen imperial nations, including one hundred thousand source mages and two hundred thousand logistics troops. They would also requisition a large number of strategic-level source artifacts to arm the military forces!</p><p></p><p>Additionally, they would borrow the Mage Association's top-level source artifact 'Door' to deploy the military forces to the Horizontal Region and eliminate the Radiant Society, undoubtedly wiping them out in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>As for the method to restrain mages' abilities, they came up with a good solution: maintain a high-intensity 'dispersion' spell.</p><p></p><p>In their view, this special effect of restraining mages' abilities would be ineffective as long as they maintained 'dispersion', or at the very least, it would greatly reduce the restraining effect.</p><p></p><p>With the plan confirmed, the seventeen imperial emperors wore smiles on their faces and held various banquets in New Era City, with fine wine and beautiful women.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a few emperors also gathered for a game of cards, using some insignificant border areas or certain industries as stakes, playing fervently.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After the seventeen imperial nations took action, Zhipeng's friends scattered across various regions quickly passed the corresponding information to the Radiant Society.</p><p></p><p>One hundred thousand source mages - who could withstand that?</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng immediately became restless and hurried to find Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled, "Don't be so anxious. You've already issued the declaration of war, so this situation was expected, wasn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng forced an ugly smile, "That may be true, but who could have imagined the other side would deploy one hundred thousand mages right from the start? You should know that the Radiant Society has less than seven thousand mages in total so far... The disparity is too vast. I'm afraid that if they launch an offensive, we'll be finished."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Don't worry, no matter how many people come, it won't make a difference. Just wait patiently! Your focus should be on how to govern a nation. How are you progressing with the book 'Politics and Philosophy' that I gave you before?"</p><p></p><p>At the mention of this, Zhipeng recalled the terror of being ruled by that thick book.</p><p></p><p>What was it... 'The world is material, material is motion, the motion of the material world is governed by laws...' </p><p></p><p>Something like 'Human practice is a conscious, purposeful activity...'</p><p></p><p>To fully comprehend this book? Please, spare him!</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng looked embarrassed, opening and closing his mouth, unsure of how to respond.</p><p></p><p>Yashan chuckled and patted Zhipeng's shoulder, "Alright, go back and study diligently! Just do what needs to be done, don't think about all this nonsense. At worst, it's just death - what's there to be afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>At worst, it's just death... </p><p></p><p>Since death is inevitable, what is there to fear?</p><p></p><p>Yashan added, "Oh, by the way, spread the news that the 'Joint Force of the Eighteen Imperial Nations' has assembled an army of one hundred thousand source mages to attack."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng was astonished, "This... will cause panic!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said indifferently, "The deeper the despair, the stronger the confidence after victory. Just do it!"</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the great Wumie Longshen for the generous contribution! I temporarily don't have the capacity to add more chapters, but I will make it up as soon as possible!</p>

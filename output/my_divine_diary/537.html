        <div class="content">
            <p>The child was only about five or six years old, his eyes were unfocused, his hair was sparse and wet from the rain and stuck to his head, and his face was dirty, so that no matter how much the rain washed it away, it couldn't be washed clean.</p><p></p><p>Exposed arms, neck, belly, calves, feet, all a long and narrow and bright red wounds, as if whipped out of the general, high swelling, horizontal and vertical!</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the bizarre disaster, a child suddenly ran out and asked curiously why they didn't hide in the rain.</p><p></p><p>They also wanted to ask this child why he ran here alone!</p><p></p><p>But after holding their tongue for a long time, they were hard pressed to ask.</p><p></p><p>Because all of them realized that something was wrong, something was wrong everywhere!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was even more puzzled, in his radar perception, he couldn't perceive the slightest reaction of blood qi on this child.</p><p></p><p>Like a corpse.</p><p></p><p>The four of them glanced at each other and signaled to each other not to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing Ah Wang prepared his attacks at the same time, and once the situation became bad, he immediately sent out an attack.</p><p></p><p>The little child seemed to get no response and became impatient and anxious, "It's raining, you guys run away!"</p><p></p><p>"The whip is hitting the body, it's scary, you guys quickly hide!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was bold and tried to respond, "We are not afraid of the rain or the whip!"</p><p></p><p>The kid seemed to be deaf and said to himself, "Hide quickly, or you won't be able to escape!"</p><p></p><p>"Snap!"</p><p></p><p>There was a crunching sound.</p><p></p><p>The shadow of a whip swung across, viciously smacking the child's body, his clothes crumbling and a wound blooming on his back once again.</p><p></p><p>The child let out a cry of pain and fell to the ground, rolling over and finally curling up.</p><p></p><p>The eyelids of a few people jumped as they watched.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a humanoid figure taller than a willow tree staggered out, his mouth revealing sharp teeth as he laughed, "There's no escape, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The figure gradually became clearer in the rain, and the four of them got a good look at it.</p><p></p><p>More than seven meters tall, with a double horned head, crimson eyes, a mouth full of fangs, and a hand full of sharp claws, grasping a long whip, it looked very gruesome!</p><p></p><p>Just because this monster was actually wearing an apron, chest high and bulging, stomach round, properly a kitchen mom's image.</p><p></p><p>What kind of strange combination is this?</p><p></p><p>The seven-meter tall amah laughed out loud, ''I told you to run! You still dare to run! Still running or not?"</p><p></p><p>"Pah-pah-pah!"</p><p></p><p>With every word, the whip in the big mom's hand lashed, beating the child to the point of dripping blood.</p><p></p><p>That child curled up on the ground, muttering, "So scary! Run away quickly and quickly! Hide hide hide~"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao experienced this kind of thing for the first time and didn't act rashly, but chose to ask the professionals, "Xing, according to your understanding, what is this situation?"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing's eyes glowed with excitement, "Perhaps, this is the nuclear! The source of the weird disaster!"</p><p></p><p>"Nuclear?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at the huge monster as well as the child in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Xing's eyes stared deathly at this 'Big Mother Monster' and his tone was very certain, "That's it! We all know that the Nucleus of Disaster has many manifestations, there is no fixed form, any possibility is possible. That is to say, nuclei that are humanoid in shape are also out there. As far as I know, there are quite a few humanoid nuclei! All of them are human metamorphoses.</p><p></p><p>And this kind of weird disaster, the most special place is that it will inherit a small part of the characteristics of the original object, in an extremely bizarre way to manifest. This is also the first time I personally met the humanoid nucleus of the weird disaster, but this is the nucleus, should not be wrong!</p><p></p><p>As long as we find the 'lead' and destroy it, we'll be able to solve this bizarre disaster!"</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang said uncertainly, "Which part is the source and which part is the lead?"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing subconsciously looked at Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao locked on to three targets, one of which was the big mom monster, the second was the child, and the third was the whip.</p><p></p><p>After some careful perception, he realized that all the fluctuations of the source all came from the child.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao voiced out his judgment, "I perceive the fluctuations of the source on that child."</p><p></p><p>Xing immediately said, "Then let's fight this monster off first!"</p><p></p><p>Right at this moment, that big mama monster turned her head towards Su Hao and the others with a fierce smile, "Huh~ Aren't you guys going to run away?"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the long whip in her hand was flung, sending out a sound explosion in the rain curtain.</p><p></p><p>"Splat!"</p><p></p><p>Countless rainwater was smacked and exploded into fine pieces.</p><p></p><p>Xing's heart trembled as he shouted, "Be careful, the whip is coming!"</p><p></p><p>Now they were in a very awkward situation! They could only hide within the 'opposite space barrier' provided by Su Hao, not daring to rush into the rain curtain. Because once they were caught in the rain, they didn't even need to fight, and their bodies would be hollowed out in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>If one didn't hide and stay where they were, wouldn't they be used as a target for the big mom monster's whip?</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing was the first to hand everything, an air blade shot out, from the inside two outside through the spatial barrier, slicing on the neck of the Big Mom Monster in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>The Big Mom Monster's head was unexpectedly sliced off by the air blade and rolled to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the head that rolled to the ground even laughed loudly, "None of you can escape!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, the headless body lashed out with a whip.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>Xing gritted his teeth and moved a body, using his body to block in front of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>He had an extremely strong chi shield over his body, so he felt self-conscious that he should be able to resist the whip lash, so he rushed up without much thought.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he wasn't sure about was whether his stomach would run away on its own when this whip lashed his body.</p><p></p><p>However, as the captain, if he was hard pressed to take a hit, let him do it! How could one back down at a critical moment?</p><p></p><p>A crunching sound of a whip hitting the air rang out.</p><p></p><p>The whip lashed past Xing and disappeared like rain.</p><p></p><p>"It didn't whip on the body!" Ah Xing's heart was shocked, wondering how Su Hao's shield had managed to do so, and in his heart, he decided that Su Hao was not only an Explosive Source Mage, but also the most inscrutable and unpredictable Trickster Source Mage!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but glance at Su Hao on the side.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Hao pointed out a finger, and a ray extended from his fingertip to the 'big mom monster'.</p><p></p><p>'Little Cannon'!</p><p></p><p>With a violent explosion, the entire Big Mother Monster split into pieces and scattered all around.</p><p></p><p>But the head was still laughing madly, and the hand that was tugging on the whip was still wielding it, lashing the four people one by one.</p><p></p><p>"'Lead' is the whip!" Su Hao instantly came to a judgment.</p><p></p><p>The real 'lead' should be this whip!</p><p></p><p>'Small Cannon'!</p><p></p><p>The whip was blown aside, but was intact!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao secretly said, "What material is it made of, so hard?"</p><p></p><p>The fragments of the 'Big Mom Monster' that blew away all around flew backward and quickly combined into the original monster's appearance, laughing and swinging the whip madly.</p><p></p><p>But without exception, all of them drew blanks, which made the crowd let go of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao carefully observed the whole whip, and found that there was a slight difference between the grip and the body of the whip, so he slightly built up his strength, and a more powerful 'small cannon' shot out, hitting the grip of the whip squarely.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>A violent explosion once again tore the body of the Big Mother Monster into pieces, and the whip grip took the brunt of the blast, shattering it instantly.</p><p></p><p>As if it had lost control, the long and large whip body fell straight to the ground, right next to the cowering child.</p><p></p><p>The child opened his eyes as if he had realized something, looked at the damaged whip, and then cautiously raised his head to look behind him.</p><p></p><p>The rain stopped, the wind died down.</p><p></p><p>The wildly swinging willows calmed down, and bits of starlight began to appear in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The 'monster' that had been weighing on his heart all this time, disappeared!</p><p></p><p>And then a strong light began to radiate from his body, illuminating the neighborhood into daylight.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!"</p><p></p><p>The light dispersed, leaving a pile of radiant source beads in the same spot.</p><p></p><p>And the huge whip that had originally fallen aside had become extremely small at this time, shrinking to about one meter, looking like a willow that had been casually picked up from the side of the road.</p><p></p><p>The willow also emitted a faint glow, and then slowly faded away, returning to its ordinary appearance.</p><p></p><p>Xing eyed what was happening and muttered, ''Is it over? We, have successfully solved the bizarre disaster ......"</p>

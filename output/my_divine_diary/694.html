        <h1>Chapter 694</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The people in the command center of the Remote Star didn't seem to have heard what Su Hao said, and they all stared blankly at Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>What did Xu Shiqiang say? It seemed like they heard him say that he was going to the planet where the star-eating insects were active?</p><p></p><p>Joking, right? It must be a joke. Why would a normal person think of going to a planet with star-eating bugs? He'd only go if he didn't want to die fast enough!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao ignored the thoughts of the crowd, but said to himself, ''I think that as long as this special bug race is thoroughly researched, we humans are bound to be able to obtain a lot with biotechnology from them. There is even a certain probability of obtaining the power to be able to fight against the Eight-Handed Race.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, what's wrong with us taking some risks? Moreover, I can guarantee the absolute safety of the Remote Star and won't joke with my own life and the lives of all of you."</p><p></p><p>This time, everyone confirmed that Xu Daqiang indeed wanted to venture to the planet of the star-eating insects.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao's words didn't impress anyone.</p><p></p><p>Even the captain who trusted Su Hao the most.</p><p></p><p>Because he thought Su Hao himself was more important to humanity than the star-eating bugs, he was thinking about how to bring Su Hao back to Blue Light safely, rather than continuing to take risks and do things that didn't matter at all after successfully evading the Eight Hands' signaling base nest.</p><p></p><p>That wasn't in the captain's plan, and besides, he had no interest in the kind of planet that was filled with bugs inside and out.</p><p></p><p>The captain directly shook his head, ''No, I can't make fun of the Remote Star just because of your one word of assurance. Moreover, the humans have organized explorations of the star-eating bugs' starfield, and have also brought a large number of star-eating bugs specimens back to Blue Light.</p><p></p><p>But nothing useful was studied. Compared to researching star-eating bugs, the most important thing for humans is to find a way to fight against the Eight-Handed Race."</p><p></p><p>The rest of them nodded in agreement with the captain's words.</p><p></p><p>The proposal was rejected, and this result was expected by Su Hao, it was only normal for the Remote Star to reject it.</p><p></p><p>He didn't force himself and squeezed the bug egg in his hand and smiled, "I would like to ask, when will the Remote Star probably go blue?"</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Around two months, and possibly earlier if the stealth camouflage is completed earlier."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao did a rough calculation and realized that it would be too late for him to go there himself personally, so he said, "I personally want to observe what the planet of the star-eating bug looks like, you guys can understand that this is one of the things that I want to accomplish, and there is a certain necessity for me.</p><p></p><p>How about, in my personal name, making a deal with the Remote Star, how about it?"</p><p></p><p>The Captain frowned, "A deal? Tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I need the Remote Starship to send me to the nearest Star Eater neighborhood, and in the process, I make sure that the Remote Starship is not infested by any Star Eater or Star Eater eggs;</p><p></p><p>What I can give is to be able to teach you all the method of obtaining 'superpowers', a method that I have researched through my own 'superpowers' over many years, and which has a certain degree of universality. In other words, not only can you learn it, but most humans can learn it.</p><p></p><p>Such an ability might be able to give humans a certain advantage in a war with the Eight Hands, just as I did against the five Eight Hands battleships.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial thing is that I can teach the 'superpower' to you in advance, and you, in turn, can transmit the 'superpower' method, back to the Blue Light, before bringing me close to the Planet of the Star Eaters.</p><p></p><p>How about it? You officers weigh who is more important, risking some inconsequential risks, or human 'superpower'."</p><p></p><p>After hearing Su Hao's words, the captain and the officers froze.</p><p></p><p>It was because Su Hao told them that they had a chance to obtain powerful 'superpowers', and also because of the 'deal' Su Hao proposed.</p><p></p><p>This made Su Hao seem so selfish to them.</p><p></p><p>How could something so important to humans be used for 'trading'? Shouldn't it be given freely to contribute something to humanity's victory over the Eight-Handed Race?</p><p></p><p>If every human had to talk about benefits when facing the threat of an alien race, then what hope was there for the future of humanity to speak of?</p><p></p><p>Years of dedication education tells all the officers here that Su Hao's behavior is not right, as a human being, for the future of mankind, he should dedicate all he has to this collective ......</p><p></p><p>Someone couldn't help but to chide Su Hao: "You ......"</p><p></p><p>The captain immediately droned, "All shut up, the old man is in charge here!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone immediately swallowed back the words that were spat to their mouths.</p><p></p><p>The captain took a deep breath, calmed his complex heart, and his tone became light, "Xu Shiqiang, the Remote Star is making this deal with you, however, I need to confirm that the method you gave is true and reliable, and send it back to the Blue Light, and only after receiving confirmation from the Blue Light will I fulfill your request.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, we will only investigate from afar, and will not approach or land.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, remember your words, you have to make sure that nothing goes wrong with the Remote Star."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao revealed a satisfied smile, "Sure, deal!"</p><p></p><p>As expected, as long as one grasped what others needed, one could use the transaction to gain great convenience.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the essence of 'making money' exactly like this? Making money was not based on how hard one worked, but whether or not, in that person's hands, there was something that others needed.</p><p></p><p>For trading with humans instead of giving away his skills for free, Su Hao didn't have too much pressure in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This kind of bondage from 'morality' didn't affect him much anymore.</p><p></p><p>He understood very well what he wanted and did his best to pursue it, not having too much heart to do too many superfluous things.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if a 'deal' or 'cooperation' could be struck, that would be the best scenario.</p><p></p><p>He believed that if the humans in this world wanted to gain the power to defeat the Eight Hands Clan and become the Cloud Ring System Overlord, cooperating with him, Su Hao, would be the best way to do so.</p><p></p><p>Trying to kidnap him as a human and make him give everything might not work.</p><p></p><p>Because the current him, and the past him, had changed a little. Now in his mind, his own needs always came first.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it didn't mean that Su Hao turned a blind eye to the human's situation, if he could help, he would definitely help, after all, he was essentially a human being, was and would be.</p><p></p><p>If Su Hao became the supreme god of this universe, then there was no doubt that humans were the supreme race of this universe.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao left, the command center was once again lively.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, did you really promise him to go to Planet Star Eater? That's too dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"Humanity organized an exploration of the star-eating bug galaxy more than a hundred years ago, eight battleships, only one came back, and it was nearly overrun by star-eating bugs. It also triggered three years of insect chaos in Blue Light ......"</p><p></p><p>The captain let out a long breath and said with a slight sense of helplessness, "I understand what you guys are saying, but the technology Xu Shiqiang has mastered is too important to us."</p><p></p><p>"But he can't be used as a bargaining chip either ......"</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Xu Shiqiang is different from us, we cannot use our standards to measure him as a person. With him, we can only cooperate, we can't force ourselves."</p><p></p><p>There was one more thing he didn't say, which was 'Even if we come on strong, all of us put together won't be able to beat him'.</p><p></p><p>A great cleverness suggested, "Or else we'll return directly to Blue Light after extracting the 'superpower' from his hands?"</p><p></p><p>The captain glanced at this person and secretly resolved to transfer this person from the Remote Star immediately after returning to Blue Light.</p><p></p><p>Damn it staying on a ship with this kind of idiot is too dangerous, you don't even know when you'll be sold.</p><p></p><p>Someone asked curiously, "Captain, you said Xu Shiqiang went to Planet Star Eater, what does he want?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe it's the young man's adventurous spirit that makes him curious about everything he sees, or maybe it's like what they play in TV dramas, when he was a kid, he made some kind of romantic pact with his childhood sweetheart girl ......"</p><p></p><p>"How damn romantic, he Xu Shiqiang is romantic, all of us on this ship have to accompany him in his adventure."</p><p></p><p>"Keep your voice down! If you have the ability, you can say it in front of others! If you don't have the ability, don't make a blind noise."</p><p></p><p>"Damn ...... I really don't have the ability ......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Su Hao gave the captain the 'superpowers' he had compiled some time ago, and personally instructed the captain to cultivate for two days.</p><p></p><p>It was only after confirming that the captain had learned the 'Point Breaking Spirit Method' that he released him to cultivate on his own.</p><p></p><p>For the next month, Su Hao took the time to guide the captain and the others to cultivate while studying the many bug eggs captured during this time in the small world.</p><p></p><p>There were fifteen of these bug eggs, and in Su Hao's divine perception, there were no signs of life, and they looked no different from a milky white jade, and if he hadn't confirmed that this thing was the eggs of a star-eating bug, he would have thought that it was just a meteorite floating around in the universe.</p><p></p><p>He had already recorded the insect egg into the pinball space and used it to observe the internal structure.</p><p></p><p>However, the internal structure of the worm egg wasn't complicated, there were three layers of structure: the outer shell, the crystal layer, and the liquid layer.</p><p></p><p>It was similar to observing an egg.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought about it and decided to activate one of the bug eggs first to observe its growth process.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, he removed one of the insect eggs and slammed it hard on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Barf!"</p><p></p><p>The insect egg shattered into pieces ......</p><p></p><p>According to the information, this was how the worm egg was activated, by breaking it with a huge force, the life system hidden in the worm egg would activate.</p><p></p><p>This type of activation method couldn't be more insidious!</p>

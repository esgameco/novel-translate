        <h1>Chapter 642</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly. Twenty years later.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had been in this world for eighty years, with an actual age of nearly a hundred years old.</p><p></p><p>He went to ask Feng Cheng about the anomaly in space, but the result he got was still 'no abnormality'!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "......"</p><p></p><p>For so many years I have worked diligently and successfully developed the 'Planet Virus', and then you tell me: we don't need to attack planets anymore, let's play another game.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this just messing with me!</p><p></p><p>The achievement of the 'Star Shattering Cube' was to turn a satellite slightly smaller than the source planet into particle beams within half a year, shooting all matter completely out of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>And the observers at the astronomical observation center watched helplessly as a huge celestial body gradually disappeared from their screens.</p><p></p><p>It was like a dream!</p><p></p><p>A tiny little cube, just by embedding a high-quality source pearl in the groove and inserting it into the planet's core, then activating it - it could devour an entire massive planet within two hours and transform the planet into a vast amount of 'source' material.</p><p></p><p>The emergence of this 'Star Shattering Cube' even exceeded Su Hao's initial imagination when he first designed the 'Planet Virus'.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps with constant technological updates, the size of the 'Planet Virus' could become even smaller in the future.</p><p></p><p>However, for Su Hao, as long as the purpose could be achieved, the size didn't matter much.</p><p></p><p>What left Su Hao speechless was that after he had finally developed a way to destroy planets, it turned out that the catastrophe was most likely not a planetary collision.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's a planetary collision or not, developing a 'Planet Virus' is ultimately useful. During my research, I also gained many derivative products that can handle most situations. Not only did I not lose, I actually gained something.</p><p></p><p>No matter what kind of catastrophe, bring it on! If it can even make me break a sweat, I lose!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Suddenly one day, Ya Shan reported to Su Hao: "Master Wei, the basic components of the spacecraft have been assembled. The test results show that it is operating well and ready for a test flight."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was surprised: "The progress is so fast? I remember two years ago it was just in the final stage, and a lot of equipment had not been installed yet."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan explained: "That's true, but the overall structure and propulsion system of the spacecraft have been built. Only various large customized machinery has not been assembled yet, plus various collection machinery, detectors, single-pilot small spacecraft, etc. are not finished. But it doesn't affect the overall operation of the spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>If it's just a test flight, then there shouldn't be a big problem. Perhaps during the test flight, we can discover deficiencies and continue to modify it."</p><p></p><p>This is the advantage of having teleportation array technology.</p><p></p><p>As long as fixed teleportation arrays are established on the spacecraft and the source planet, they can travel back and forth at will. If one day they feel the spacecraft is not good, they can even leave a positioning stone on site, then teleport the spacecraft back for modifications. Once modified, they can teleport it back to the original position and continue the journey.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Then let's test it!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan had already temporarily dismissed all the workers involved in building the spacecraft. Currently in the small world base, there were only four people.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Fei Yao, that guy, wouldn't want to miss this. He was extremely curious about everything related to Su Hao and the other two. He wanted to know about the lives of these three aliens.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Fei Yao was already planning to write a book called 'My Cohabitation Life with Aliens'.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng suggested: "Master Wei, Master Ya, why don't we give the spacecraft a name before the test flight?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's eyes lit up: "Good idea."</p><p></p><p>Then everyone looked at Su Hao together.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled slightly, pondered for a moment and said: "Then let's call it the 'Genesis'!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shaken, a indescribable sense of excitement invading their bodies. They understood Su Hao's meaning - the beginning of a journey through the infinite universe.</p><p></p><p>What could be more exciting than this?</p><p></p><p>The three of them didn't have any fancy test flight ceremony. The process was very simple: Su Hao teleported the small world base in one go to the currently known farthest outer space, and then set off deeper into the universe.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this test flight was not only a test, but also the beginning of their cosmic journey. Once this 'Genesis' spacecraft took off, it would never return to the source planet again.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao flashed and appeared outside the spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a small compact spacecraft was parked on a flat platform at the top of a small island mountain, ferocious and powerful yet not lacking in beauty, with smooth and sci-fi lines, perfectly embodying a mechanical feel.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just exterior decoration!</p><p></p><p>It only had a 'source energy shield system' installed to resist the impact of cosmic dust and small meteorites. Essentially, it didn't have any powerful functions. If one had to say it had any, it would be that Su Hao liked it.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao transformed into his 'Command Seed' form, put on various protective shields, placed one hand on the spacecraft and linked to the farthest positioning stone.</p><p></p><p>'Teleport'!</p><p></p><p>His entire being and the spacecraft abruptly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>When they reappeared, they were already at a position 50 billion kilometers away from the source planet.</p><p></p><p>50 billion kilometers - what a concept! Even traveling at the speed of light, it would take more than four hours to reach!</p><p></p><p>The Red Ice Star originally had two moons, but one of them had been ruthlessly sent away by Su Hao, probably now turned into particle beams freely wandering in the universe.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the moon, Su Hao did not stop there, flashing consecutively more than twenty times, taking the 'Genesis' away from the moon, far away from this enormously massive Red Ice Star.</p><p></p><p>Having basically escaped the gravitational pull of the Red Ice Star, Su Hao sent a message: "Okay Ya Shan, start the test flight!"</p><p></p><p>Following Su Hao's words, Ya Shan arranged for Feng Cheng and Fei Yao to assist in starting up the spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't much, just opening the switch and then assisting in checking if various equipment was operating normally, while detecting the surrounding environment and controlling the direction of travel.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light lit up in the three large nozzles at the rear of the spacecraft, spewing forth a violent aura. It should have made a tremendous roar, but in the vacuum of space, there was only silence.</p><p></p><p>The golden light gradually intensified, and a huge blaze of fire erupted from the three large nozzles, shooting straight out for hundreds of meters, nearly a hundred times longer than the spacecraft itself.</p><p></p><p>It was like a flashlight shining into the night sky!</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Su Hao said: "Ya Shan, open up the propulsion to full power, accelerate to maximum speed!"</p><p></p><p>There was silence in the group for a moment, then Ya Shan sent a dog head emoji: "Master Wei, well, this is already the maximum power output. To accelerate further, we'll probably have to wait a bit!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at the sluggishly moving spacecraft in front of him, and the violent propulsion at the rear, sending a question mark: "???"</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Ya Shan, Feng Cheng, and even Fei Yao who had reached the Yuan Ying realm, came out from inside the spacecraft, all wearing various protective gear.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng looked at the sluggishly moving spacecraft in front of them, showing embarrassed expressions.</p><p></p><p>Although they knew that for a spacecraft to fly in space, it only needed inertia and some propulsive force exceeding various gravitational pulls, and that its speed would increase over time through accumulation.</p><p></p><p>But the problem was, this was too slow.</p><p></p><p>At this speed, it was impossible to even exceed the escape velocity of an ordinary planet for a normal takeoff.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sluggish appearance of the spacecraft, Ya Shan really wanted to go over and give it a push to alleviate the awkwardness.</p><p></p><p>But he resisted the urge, sending a self-critical message in the group: "Master Wei, I did calculate the thrust of these propulsion engines, but I don't know why this situation occurred. It's weaker than I imagined! Next I need to modify and continue enhancing it..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head: "It's not that the propulsion is too weak, it's that the mass of the spacecraft is too large. No matter how much these conventional propulsion engines are enhanced, it will be useless."</p><p></p><p>Although the spacecraft looked only as big as a small house, its mass did not decrease just because it was stuffed into the small world and appeared smaller - it was still that of a large mass island.</p><p></p><p>Now remodeled into a metal structure, its mass was several times greater.</p><p></p><p>How could ordinary propulsion engines serve as the propulsion for this spacecraft? Unless the entire spacecraft was covered in propulsion engines.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan scratched his head: "I did consider this issue, but I had the idea to try it out first. I didn't expect it to be so outrageous. Master Wei, what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment, then suddenly noticed the asteroid belt around the Red Ice Star's moon, his eyes lit up as he pointed to that moon: "I'll construct three small worlds inside the three large nozzles, then we'll carve out that asteroid belt and turn it into source material to stuff into the three nozzle small worlds, using source as the propulsive force for the spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>This way, the propulsive force should be enough."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng simultaneously turned their greedy green gazes towards the thin asteroid belt rotating around the moon.  </p><p></p><p>Fei Yao snapped out of his shock from observing the Red Ice Star, full of confusion: "What did they say? What are they doing? Why are they staring at the Red Ice moon with such a terrible gaze?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 778</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After seeing Yuan Tan walk in, Su Hao pointed to the experiment table next to him and said, "Sit!"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan trembled imperceptibly all over, though extremely apprehensive in his heart, he did not dare to disobey Su Hao's order and obediently sat on the experiment table.</p><p></p><p>His heartbeat gradually quickened.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "You look very nervous?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan: "No...well, a little."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Don't be nervous, I called you in because I want to ask you something."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed to the three dragon corpses and asked, "I poured the water from the Mother Goddess Pool into their bodies, why did they not gain magic power and died instead? Isn't this how you awaken your powers?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan observed them and said, "To awaken our magic powers, we do indeed directly drink the water from the Mother Goddess Pool, but it's usually done during our infancy.</p><p></p><p>When infant dragons drink the water from the Mother Goddess Pool, five or six out of ten can successfully awaken their powers, survive and transform into Winged Gods. The purer the Winged God bloodline, the higher the survival rate.</p><p></p><p>But for adult dragons drinking the Mother Goddess Pool water, one out of ten surviving is already very good."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "I see, so the pool water needs to be consumed during the infant stage when their vitality is strongest in order to possibly survive."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan was stunned at first, then asked uncertainly, "You said...poured?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Of course."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan: "How much did you pour into them at once?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually pointed to the large basin next to him.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss--" Yuan Tan gasped, his face full of horror.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan said, "You poured too much into them at once...that's definitely fatal. Even an adult Winged God couldn't withstand that much.</p><p></p><p>Our way of awakening as Winged Gods has always been feeding them bit by bit. The first time is only a small spoonful, and after adapting for at least half a year, they'll drink a second spoonful. The amount consumed increases year by year until they gain enough power.</p><p></p><p>To pour in this much all at once...to be honest, even those of royal bloodlines may not survive."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao realized his mistake.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The three great generals waited nervously outside, waiting for Yuan Tan's screams of agony, but no matter how long they waited, they didn't hear any.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon of Essence, Yuan Zhao, looked mournful, "It seems Saint Yuan Tan didn't even last an hour before dying. It's better this way, so he doesn't have to endure such prolonged torture."</p><p></p><p>The other two dragons nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Dragon said, "After all, we couldn't get out of here. This must be our final resting place."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Rock Dragon slowly lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>Just as the three generals were feeling down, they surprisingly saw Yuan Tan walk out of Su Hao's laboratory.</p><p></p><p>The three generals' eyes widened in shock. The Tyrant Dragon exclaimed in astonishment, "How are you not dead yet?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan's eyelid twitched as he looked at the Tyrant Dragon speechlessly, "Do you really wish for my death that much?"</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Dragon said embarrassedly, "No, I was just curious about what happened to you in there."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan just shook his head, remaining tight-lipped.</p><p></p><p>The three generals didn't dare ask about what happened in the laboratory either.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon of Essence sighed, "I don't know if we'll still have a chance to get out, or if we'll all die here. I'm also unaware of the situation outside, or whether the Sacred Mountain has been completely liberated. If it is liberated, then our sacrifice would be worth it."</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Dragon smiled, "Almost all Winged Gods have been captured here, and even the strongest Winged God Saint's fate is unknown. Don't need to think about it, the Winged Gods have already become history."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan rarely showed a smile, "I hope so. With the disappearance of the Winged Gods, all dragon races will usher in a new era of unity without discrimination, prejudice or enslavement."</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, Yuan Tan's tone became exceptionally firm, "I must get out of here to witness the new world we created with our own hands. It must be the world we've dreamed of."</p><p></p><p>The three great generals all nodded in agreement, filled with hope for the future.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan said, "No matter what happens, we must endure. Even if it's just to go out and see that world."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan and the dragons endured for five years.</p><p></p><p>Five years later, one day Su Hao walked out of the laboratory and told all the dragons, "I have obtained all the information I wanted, you can leave now."</p><p></p><p>Over the five years, Su Hao had ruthlessly experimented to death one-third of the originally massive number of dragon specimens.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Su Hao's words, the remaining dragon specimens were stunned as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Did I just hear that right? I don't think I heard clearly."</p><p></p><p>"We can leave? Did Jia Wei really just say we can go out?"</p><p></p><p>"I...I'm still alive, and I can go out. I can go home..."</p><p></p><p>"It's unbelievable. This period of time felt like a dream to me."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan stared blankly in Su Hao's direction, almost shedding tears of excitement.</p><p></p><p>The three great generals looked much thinner, their dragon faces showing haggard expressions.</p><p></p><p>They also looked utterly disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon of Essence couldn't help but exclaim, "No wonder you're the Saint Yuan Tan, you taught me endurance!"</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Dragon said, "Yes, if it weren't for Saint Yuan Tan persuading us time and again, I would have probably charged at Jia Wei recklessly and gotten killed by him easily."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan said, "My perseverance was meaningful. I said I would never die here, and that I would definitely go out and see the era we created with our own hands."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan took the initiative to approach Su Hao and asked, "Jia Wei, where do we leave your world from?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually pointed in a direction.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan and the others looked where Su Hao pointed and saw a huge archway appear on the wall of the small world, clearly showing the scenery outside.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to Su Hao, Yuan Tan and the others couldn't help but let out long roars towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Roar--"  </p><p>"Ahhh--"</p><p></p><p>He spread his wings first and flew towards the archway. Seeing him fly out, the other dragon specimens hesitated for a moment before following, either flying or running, and successively left this small world.</p><p></p><p>They had regained their freedom.</p><p></p><p>After all the dragons confirmed they had left the small world and returned to their own, each one let out excited cries, wildly venting the pent-up emotions in their chests.</p><p></p><p>The previous despair that almost destroyed the world was now filled with the joy of regaining freedom.</p><p></p><p>The vast world was open for them to fly and roam freely.</p><p></p><p>The three great generals came to Yuan Tan's side and looked towards the Winged God group on the other side.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Dragon proposed, "Saint Yuan Tan, since the Winged God Saint's fate is unknown, why don't we take this opportunity to regroup and slaughter all these Winged Gods?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan shook his head, "There's no need. Ever since Jia Wei imprisoned us in his world, there are no more gods. From now on, there are only dragon races! Because five years have passed, and the Sacred Mountain no longer belongs to the Winged Gods. Believe me, everything has changed!"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon of Essence and Rock Dragon highly agreed with Yuan Tan's words and nodded, "That's right, countless facts have proven Saint Yuan Tan's foresight. This time is no exception, listening to the Saint is never wrong."</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Dragon also nodded in agreement, but there was a strange glint in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Dragon asked, "Then where do we go next?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan said, "Let's go to the Sacred Mountain first. The Three-Race Alliance must have sent people to station there."</p><p></p><p>The three generals nodded and led the remaining troops to follow Yuan Tan in climbing the Sacred Mountain.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, though the Winged God race had lost their Saint, a new Winged God leader took on the responsibility of leading them.</p><p></p><p>It glared fiercely at Yuan Tan and the others, wanting to kill them all immediately, but still endured.</p><p></p><p>The five years had struck a blow to the Winged Gods' arrogance and taught them patience.</p><p></p><p>The Winged God leader looked up at the Sacred Mountain, then turned to lead his troops away, "It's not wise to return to the Sacred Mountain now. Let's temporarily retreat and find a place to recuperate first.</p><p></p><p>One day, we will take back our territory.</p><p></p><p>We are still the gods ruling this world."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As for what would happen to these released dragon specimens, it no longer concerned Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>His preliminary research on the special powers of this world was complete, no longer requiring the dragon specimens for various experiments.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, he had successfully built an 'spiritual power grid' pervading the entire body of the 'Eight-Armed God'.</p><p></p><p>Without disrupting the original spiritual power structure, he built another interconnected spiritual power grid structure within the body, causing the spiritual power content to soar by more than ten times.</p><p></p><p>According to Su Hao's estimation, the physical lifespan would also be greatly extended. Based on the current trend, he could live for at least eight thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself, "If combined with the external brain, it's essentially a whole new realm far beyond the Deity Transformation stage."</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment, this new realm needed a suitable name.</p><p></p><p>"Since it divides into countless divine thoughts, let's call it the 'Divine Separation Realm'!"</p>

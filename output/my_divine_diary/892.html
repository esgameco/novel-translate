        <h1>Chapter 892</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After successfully carrying out a 'man-made controllable crisis', the deities felt very self-satisfied, speaking in much louder voices, no longer showing any signs of self-doubt from before.</p><p></p><p>Through the success of this operation, coupled with the current two world wills being quite outstanding, they were filled with hope for the future, believing they could successfully guide the world wills to maturity.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the deities did not play games this time, but instead envisioned one perfect 'coincidence' after another in their minds, and then fervently discussed them in the group.</p><p></p><p>Each of the eighteen deities had experienced a long period of time and witnessed all kinds of melodramatic events, so concocting dramatic plots came naturally to them.</p><p></p><p>The Order Deity - Red Light excitedly said, "It's been over a thousand years, and we haven't been able to do anything about the Crimson Demon Lord, allowing him to become increasingly arrogant. Why don't we create a main storyline that ultimately leads to the Crimson Demon Lord, guiding the world wills to defeat him?"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Deity - Barry's eyes lit up, "Good idea! Ordinary heroes indeed can't deal with that dragon, as their strength is simply not on the same level. No matter how many heroes, it would be in vain. But world wills are different - they have access to the mall, allowing them to acquire powerful talents and bloodlines through exchange, ensuring their status is not beneath the Crimson Demon Lord's."</p><p></p><p>The other deities chimed in agreement, happy to see the Crimson Demon Lord humiliated if given the chance.</p><p></p><p>"Let's first design the next crisis. After safely overcoming it, these two world wills should have grown to a certain extent. We can then guide them to the world of heroes and find an opportunity to give each of them a powerful soul fruit, allowing them to fully mature.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, we'll continuously create conflicts, provoking the Crimson Demon Lord's hatred. By then, we won't even need to assign missions - the two world wills will see defeating the Crimson Demon Lord as a necessary task."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I can't wait to see that golden dragon getting beaten senseless!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, Cong Shuling hid in her room, attempting to sense her internal energy flow again. Shortly after closing her eyes, she became excited and lost control, exiting her meditative state. "Great, I can really sense the energy flow. I can cultivate inner strength again!"</p><p></p><p>She marveled, "This Diligence System is truly amazing, capable of such feats. So the items in the mall must be real too, even the Stellar Child that can live for a million years exists. Unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>After calming her excitement, she entered meditation again, focusing on her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Only with immense inner strength could she gain a greater sense of security.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, after confirming her parents had left, Cong Shuling approached Cong Renfei, "Brother Gail, come with me. I have something to discuss with you."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei was stunned but quickly nodded, "Me too."</p><p></p><p>The siblings then headed out of the small town, eventually reaching a deserted area.</p><p></p><p>Neither spoke along the way, suddenly feeling the person they had lived with all this time was both familiar and unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>Upon realizing the other might also possess a system, their first thought was to eliminate the other to have the system to themselves.</p><p></p><p>But they quickly dismissed this idea, as they were siblings and could never harm each other.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they didn't know how many others had systems or what the attitudes between them were. Without fully understanding the situation, they wouldn't act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Their previous life's death resulted from acting recklessly without sufficient understanding - a mistake they vowed not to repeat in this life.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Cong Renfei carefully asked, "Tali, where did that healing medicine in your hand come from that night?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling didn't answer immediately, instead asking the Diligence System in her mind, "Diligence, can I reveal your existence to him?"</p><p></p><p>She had carefully studied the system before and noticed a note: Strictly prohibit revealing the system's existence.</p><p></p><p>But she wasn't sure if this prohibition applied to her brother, who seemed to possess a similar system.</p><p></p><p>The Diligent Assistant replied, "Cannot reveal the system's existence to non-system holders."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling understood, suddenly drawing out a steel blade and pointing the blunt side at Cong Renfei, "I cannot say more. Let's have a bout to know each other's identities. Just until one side yields."</p><p></p><p>The skills exchanged from the system were quite unique. Using them would undoubtedly reveal one's identity without needing further explanation.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei had the same idea, drawing out his long blade and pointing the blunt side at Cong Shuling, "Come on!"</p><p></p><p>They locked eyes, the air growing tense.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling's gaze focused as she sprang forward, slashing her blade horizontally.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei blocked with his blade, and they began exchanging moves, unleashing various techniques in a flurry of attacks and counterattacks. Their blades clashed with crisp sounds, spraying sparks.</p><p></p><p>Yet the more they fought, the more puzzled they became - why did these moves feel so familiar? This was the Cong Family Blade Art, but how did the other know it?</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling's brow furrowed as she suddenly increased her force, raining down a storm of blade lights on Cong Renfei.</p><p></p><p>Though older and stronger than Cong Shuling, Cong Renfei's blade skills ultimately fell short, and he soon found himself struggling to fend off her relentless assault.</p><p></p><p>Seizing an opportunity, Cong Shuling fiercely deflected his blade.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei's long blade flew aside as he froze in place.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling pointed her blade at him, "Speak! Why do you know the Cong Family Blade Art? Did you exchange for it with your system? It's too expensive!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei held up his hands, "I want to ask you the same! I didn't exchange it with a system - it's too costly!"</p><p></p><p>"Ding dong!"</p><p></p><p>"Found a system holder. 10 points activated team function. Activate?"</p><p></p><p>The siblings were speechless - they could team up?</p><p></p><p>But they had no time to ponder this as they focused on each other's implications.</p><p></p><p>They asked in unison, "You're from the Cong Family?"</p><p></p><p>No need for answers - they both realized the other was from the Cong Family...</p><p></p><p>Thinking to themselves: How bizarre? Changing worlds and still running into fellow clansmen. If the other is an elder, then what to do going forward?</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "My name is Cong Renfei."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling's eyes nearly popped out, "What???"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei was confused, "What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm your sister!!!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "???"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The deities observing the two siblings were also very surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Hey? It seems these two world wills knew each other before awakening?"</p><p></p><p>"It's normal. According to Sir Leian, before world wills awaken, they are randomly simulated with a persona for deployment. Perhaps these two world wills had a mental split, dividing into brother and sister."</p><p></p><p>"But they're siblings now, that's a bit messy!"</p><p></p><p>"For world wills, messiness is normal. They dare do things like mental splits - I'm willing to call them the second strongest. Yeah... the strongest is Sir Leian, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... I feel there's something strange, like I understand something, but this matter is extremely complicated. You don't need to know - even if I told you, you might not understand. So I might as well not say anything. Those who get it, get it. Those who don't, don't need to dwell on it..."</p><p></p><p>"Geez, saying that is the same as not saying anything at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, regarding Sir Leian's matters, even if I know, I can't say. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"If you don't get it, you don't get it. I'm going back to play my game."</p><p></p><p>"Me too, see you in the game. It's Fern and her group's turn to watch over them now, right? According to the timeline, there shouldn't be any issues for a year. We can initiate the second 'crisis' event after a year. We'll discuss it then."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the deities left one by one, leaving only Fern and Eternal to look at each other.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 810</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the back-and-forth questioning, Su Hao quickly grasped what he wanted to know.</p><p></p><p>However, the group of people in front of him were too low-level, unable to provide him with more information.</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, from level one to seven, there was also a so-called level 'eight' of 'Divine Envoy', and above that a level 'nine' of 'Deputy God', above the God of Fortune. There was even a level 'ten' of 'Supreme God', totaling ten levels. These people were at most level four, how much could they know?</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao currently only dared to think about it, not act on it. After all, the 'Supreme God' sounded formidable, possessing some kind of powerful force that he didn't know about. What if it was even more powerful than his strongest state in his previous life? Wouldn't he be finished then?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "I'll keep a low profile for now. After recovering all my powers and hiding my main body in the second-level world, I can then control my 'Divine' avatar to go out. I'll be the boss then, but not now.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the matter of the 'Divine' avatar needs to be dealt with as soon as possible. After all, there's a wave hanging over my head, so it's hard to say if some deity might accidentally encounter me and take a keen interest in me, then casually get rid of me..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's thoughts spun around, and he turned to look at the only soul technician Weiya and said, "I remember you used a soul technique before that could turn my crystal armor into stone. Can you still use it?"</p><p></p><p>Weiya nodded and said, "Your Divine Majesty, the soul technique I used is called the 'Soul Breaking Technique'. It's the first soul technique that a soul technician must learn after becoming one, and almost all soul technicians know it."</p><p></p><p>A transforming adamantine armor rose up from beneath Su Hao's feet, extending towards Weiya as he said, "Use the 'Soul Breaking Technique' on it again."</p><p></p><p>Weiya didn't hesitate, using the soul breaking technique very smoothly. A purple light shone from her hands onto Su Hao's adamantine armor.</p><p></p><p>When the adamantine armor was illuminated by the purple light, its internal structure immediately collapsed, quickly degrading into mud and stone. The cells of Su Hao that were mixed with the mud also lost control under the purple light, only regaining control after the purple light dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao raised his eyebrows: "This soul technique is indeed formidable. Do it again."</p><p></p><p>Weiya used the 'Soul Breaking Technique' again.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, impressive. Again."</p><p></p><p>"So it disrupted my control information? Again."  </p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect soul techniques to be so special. Again."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Weiya used the 'Soul Breaking Technique' over and over again, while Su Hao stood by and carefully sensed the effects of the technique with his 'spiritual sense'.</p><p></p><p>He quickly understood the basic principles.</p><p></p><p>The purple light called the 'Soul Breaking Technique' contained a vast amount of chaotic and disordered information, with extremely strong impact force. After shining on the adamantine armor, it could instantly scatter the 'spiritual power information' that Su Hao used to control the transformed armor, causing the armor to lose control and degrade back into ordinary mud and stone.</p><p></p><p>The essence of this 'Soul Breaking Technique' was an 'information flow'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao clicked his tongue in admiration: "Information flow can be used like this, it's simply a brilliant conception. So the so-called soul power is likely some kind of force that can carry information. The information this force can carry may even include 'consciousness information'.</p><p></p><p>For me, this is another completely new discovery, another completely new knowledge system."</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, Weiya's face had turned pale, and she was sweating profusely, unable to cast any more soul techniques.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Su Hao stopped his observation, smiling: "Hmm, I was too focused on the effects of the soul technique and didn't notice your over-expenditure of soul power. Let's stop here for today, rest well. I'll find you all again in a couple of days for some simple experiments.</p><p></p><p>Oh, by the way, will your soul power recover within two days?"</p><p></p><p>Weiya shook her head: "It will take at least five days."</p><p></p><p>The bearded Westborough said, "For us Soul Guards, it takes even longer for our soul power to recover, probably about ten days to fully recover."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't understand: "Don't you have any direct replenishment items?"</p><p></p><p>The bearded Westborough said, "We need to return to the temple of the Golden God Bari, pray to the deity, and offer enough money. Then there's a chance the deity will respond and allow us to recover our soul power."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said expressionlessly: "Then you all can recover slowly! You'll be living here for a while, the conditions will be a bit harsh temporarily. Bear with it for a bit, in about a month I'll renovate this place and it will be much better."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Su Hao directly transmitted away, returning to the seaside lair.</p><p></p><p>Refusing the young dragons' invitations to play without mercy, he lay down and entered the Pinball Space to continue analyzing the giant sea eagle's egg.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed quietly, as if all danger had left, and life had returned to its usual tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Training spiritual power, researching the sea eagle egg to create a 'Divine Egg' to hatch an avatar, transforming a large amount of source material as reserves, building an 'external brain' to prepare for the Separating Spirit Realm advancement, designing core runes to prepare for the Martial Arts Grandmaster advancement...</p><p></p><p>It seemed there were many things to do, messy and disorganized, with no idea where to start. But if he calmed down and tackled them one by one, he found that each was quite simple and could be completed quickly.</p><p></p><p>On this day a month later, the mother dragon went out hunting again, while Su Hao prepared to continue gene modification to advance to the Martial Arts Grandmaster level.</p><p></p><p>But before that, to ensure he wouldn't encounter any other dangers while in dormant state like last time, he specifically patrolled around the lair. Finding no issues, he returned to the lair and entered the base small world.</p><p></p><p>This gene modification mainly involved engraving a 'compound core rune' within his body, as well as fixing some issues left over from the previous 'Fate Seed' evolution, and additionally installing some other useful modules like 'Life Perception', 'Dynamic Vision', 'Spatial Balance', etc.</p><p></p><p>After successfully evolving this time, most of Su Hao's strength would return. He just needed to further improve modules like the 'external brain' and 'Blue Crystal Star System Network' afterwards to return to his peak.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Seer' involves deeper modifications to the brain, so it's not good to do it together with the others. I'll evolve into the 'Seer' separately after going through the one-month adaptation period for this gene modification! There's still plenty of time ahead, no need to rush."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao injected the filtered gene modification liquid into his body with a syringe, found a comfortable spot to lie down, and quickly fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave crashed against the cliff, making a thunderous roar of shattering water spray. Various large birds circled along the cliff, searching for fish schools. Occasionally a seabird would plunge into the ocean, emerging shortly after with a plump fish in its beak.</p><p></p><p>Many seabirds that approached the dragon's lair sensed the dragon's aura and flew away in panic.</p><p></p><p>From above, one could vaguely see huge shadows slowly moving in the seemingly calm ocean, as if hiding some great terror.</p><p></p><p>This time, the accident Su Hao was worried about did not occur, and everything proceeded normally.</p><p></p><p>Five hours later, he woke up successfully after completing the second gene modification.</p><p></p><p>He first closed his eyes and sensed his body, finding no abnormalities. He then entered the Pinball Space to examine the evolution in more detail.</p><p></p><p>"Perfectly completed according to the original plan. Next is to activate the core rune!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he withdrew and focused his attention, slowly guiding his blood essence into the core rune.</p><p></p><p>At a certain instant, all the blood essence in his body was connected by the core rune into a larger whole. It was at this moment that a special fluctuation burst outward from Su Hao's body, allowing him to perceive all the blood essence within a radius of over ten thousand meters in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The familiar 'radar' had returned!</p><p></p><p>He then channeled his spiritual power, mixing it with the blood essence into the core rune within his body.</p><p></p><p>"Hum~"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power also showed a tendency to be connected by the core rune.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, his perception range exploded to nearly sixty thousand meters. Within this range, he could vaguely observe not just blood essence, but also various terrains and landscapes.</p><p></p><p>This was the powerful effect of spiritual sense amplified by the core rune. After he broke through to the Separating Spirit Realm, his perception range would increase explosively again.</p><p></p><p>It was only limited by his current spiritual power not yet recovering to the peak state, so the perception range had also not reached the maximum of two hundred thousand meters. But it was enough.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao flashed and moved from the cave to the top of the seaside cliff. Closing his eyes, he sensed his current power.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he couldn't help but exclaim: "Compared to the temporary core rune built on my tail, this core rune engraved on my body is much more intuitive to use. Most importantly, my spatial abilities now have seamless continuity. This is my complete state!</p><p></p><p>'Dynamic Vision' is usable, neural reflex speed is significantly faster;</p><p></p><p>'Life Perception' can discern the current state of life, in a sense better than the Perception Rune;</p><p></p><p>'Opposing Spatial Barrier' is very stable;  </p><p></p><p>The balance of the 'second-level world' can be controlled for long periods, so I can create a major headquarters second-level world;</p><p></p><p>The 'Focus System' is fully unlocked, allowing me to obtain a large amount of source pearls anytime, anywhere, no need to worry about energy anymore;</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>So perfect!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 991</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lan Zi Star, now called the 'Central World', is also the birthplace of disciples from the Infinite Gate and Twin Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari, Winged Human King Quanfugui, Beastman King Heijier, and Sea King Yuanshu gathered in the office, discussing matters related to their old classmates becoming disciples.</p><p></p><p>Basically, the entire Infinite Gate was under the control of these four.  </p><p></p><p>Quanfugui handed the list to Vari and said, "Elder Brother, these are the old classmates who want to rejoin the Infinite Gate, led by the Gigantic Demon King and Ghost King, thirty-six in total. Should we meet with them?"</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari looked over the list and nodded, "We should, but there's no need to rush. We still need to make the final confirmation on how to handle this. The Master is unwilling to accept them as disciples, leaving it for us to deal with, but this matter is quite complicated."</p><p></p><p>Quanfugui said, "We can accept them as disciples, then they will be under the Infinite Gate."</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari shook his head, "Who will accept these disciples? The Master's intention is, whoever accepts them is responsible for resolving any issues that arise. For us, there's no need to take this risk for the sake of classmate relations, otherwise we may end up unable to even be classmates in the end.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, we were all originally peers, but taking them as disciples would lower their status unfairly. Although there may not be issues initially, it will eventually plant seeds of discontent.</p><p></p><p>Either they'll be dissatisfied with us, or with the Master. We cannot accept either, because as long as the Master is around, our future time is theoretically unlimited, and any seeds of discontent will take root and grow into towering trees.</p><p></p><p>So, accepting them as disciples is not appropriate."</p><p></p><p>Quanfugui thought about it and agreed it was true, then asked, "Then what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Vari said, "No one should accept them as disciples, just let them remain the Master's students. We'll designate the current Infinite Gate as the inner sect, and establish an outer sect outside of it. These old classmates can join the outer sect of the Infinite Gate and elect their own elder representatives.</p><p></p><p>In this way, they'll belong to our Infinite Gate, just an independent branch separate from the current inner sect.</p><p></p><p>There won't be a sense of lower status, and when there are missions, we can assign them directly to the entire outer sect for them to figure out solutions themselves.</p><p></p><p>Any conflicts will just be internal issues within their outer sect."</p><p></p><p>The other three looked at each other and agreed this method was feasible.</p><p></p><p>The Sea King Yuanshu raised a question, "Won't they feel that as the outer sect, they are lower than the inner sect?"</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari smiled, "That's natural, but the outer sect being lower than the inner sect is only reasonable. They won't compare themselves to the entire Infinite Gate.</p><p></p><p>In other words, once they accept the outer sect setting, they'll subconsciously feel unable to compare with the inner sect. No matter how unfair the treatment between inner and outer sect, they won't feel dissatisfied in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, we'll design a welfare promotion channel for the outer sect, allowing them to strive for advancement to obtain what they want.</p><p></p><p>We'll make it clear to them - if you want fairness, you need to make specific contributions."</p><p></p><p>This proposal was quickly accepted by the others.</p><p></p><p>Near the end of the meeting, the Beastman King Heijier suddenly said, "Elder Brother, since these old classmates left their races, the conflicts in the Xianghu region of the Infinite Land have intensified. Many races have formed offensive alliances, increasing military training, and a great war may break out soon. Our races will also be involved."</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari frowned, "So?"</p><p></p><p>The Beastman King Heijier said, "After all, those were the races we grew up in, we have some feelings for them. Can we intervene to protect them in special circumstances?"</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari said, "The racial rulers hold an 'Outer Domain Order' that is passed down generation to generation. When their race is in extreme danger, they can lead their race out of the Infinite Land and into the outer domain to multiply.</p><p></p><p>So there's no need for us to do anything extra. Moreover, the Infinite Gate has many master brothers from different races. If everyone intervenes, won't it end up in a bloody mess?"</p><p></p><p>The Beastman King Heijier fell silent, "Ah, I understand, Elder Brother."</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari knew what he was thinking and continued, "Don't have any expectations for your race, their ultimate fate is already determined - to be defeated, then enter the outer domain to multiply, never able to return to the Infinite Land.</p><p></p><p>Because in the end, the victor of this Infinite Land can only be humans. Understand?</p><p></p><p>Essentially, we are all human. The Master is human, the Grand Masters are human. If you want to help, then help the humans!"</p><p></p><p>The Beastman King Heijier suddenly realized and said seriously, "I understand, Elder Brother."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the four discussed the outer sect matters in detail and reported to Yashan, obtaining his approval. They then went to the Infinite Land to meet the Gigantic Demon King and other old classmates.</p><p></p><p>The two sides sighed at how time flies and the world changes.</p><p></p><p>Then the Elf King Vari explained the outer sect proposal in detail and asked, "What do you think? This is the Master's approved plan, we have no other options besides this."</p><p></p><p>The Gigantic Demon King didn't hesitate and immediately agreed to the proposal after Vari finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>Because before coming, he had already prepared himself for not being accepted.</p><p></p><p>For him, as long as he could join the Infinite Gate, it was already the best outcome. What more could he ask for?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other old classmates also expressed their agreement one by one.</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari showed a brilliant smile, "Welcome to the Infinite Gate, from now on we are master brothers. By the way, let me take you back to the Infinite Gate headquarters first, we can discuss further details there."</p><p></p><p>The Gigantic Demon King curiously asked, "Where is the headquarters?"</p><p></p><p>Vari mysteriously replied, "Your hometown, called the Lan Zi Star, also known as the Central World."</p><p></p><p>"Hometown?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Regarding the outer sect of the Infinite Gate, Yashan didn't pay much attention after hearing Vari's proposal and casually agreed.</p><p></p><p>His focus was almost entirely on the new world he was remodeling.</p><p></p><p>This was the long-designed 'Bizarre World' for exploring the 'Speech Arts', and it was now showing initial results.</p><p></p><p>He hid in mid-air, watching a ponytailed man trapped in a mud pit below, unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>That ponytailed man panicked, grabbing at the surrounding mud, trying to free himself, but the more he moved, the deeper he sank.</p><p></p><p>"What do I do? I'm going to die..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the ponytailed man's eyes lit up, as if he had a brilliant idea: "I'm stuck in this mud pit and can't climb out myself, but if someone pulls me, I'll be free, right?"</p><p></p><p>He looked around and saw no one else, so he said, "In that case, I'll have to pull myself out."</p><p></p><p>He then reached back and grabbed his own hair, pulling up with force...</p><p></p><p>The ponytailed man was lifted up by himself, escaping danger. Relieved yet proud, he said, "It's a good thing I'm smart, or I would've died for sure."</p><p></p><p>Yashan in mid-air showed a satisfied smile, then flashed away, appearing in another corner of the world.</p><p></p><p>A man wielding a knife was cornered at a cliff edge by a group of vicious thugs, unable to flee further. Seeing the powerful knife-wielding thugs behind him, he realized he had no chance of winning by himself. So he thought, "Going back will mean death, but jumping off the cliff leaves a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>He leapt off the cliff.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, there were many protruding branches that slowed his fall, allowing him to grab onto a sturdy vine and avoid falling to his death.</p><p></p><p>But as he climbed down the vine, he soon realized it wasn't long enough to reach the ground safely.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have the strength to climb back up, and the vine isn't long enough to descend. If I let go from this height, I'll definitely die from the fall. What do I do?"</p><p></p><p>After much thought, he had an epiphany: "If I cut off the upper half of this vine and attach it to the lower end, then my vine will become longer, right?"</p><p></p><p>Delighted by his cleverness, he cut off the upper half of the vine he was holding and attached it to the lower end. He then slid down the extended vine.</p><p></p><p>Repeating this process of cutting and reattaching the vine segments, he eventually descended safely to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Thank goodness I'm smart, or I would've died for sure."</p><p></p><p>Yashan showed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>He was very pleased with this kind of world.</p><p></p><p>The book is preparing for completion ~ Regarding the update issue, I'll say this in advance: The ending stage is difficult to write, so I have to slow down the pace, otherwise I can't squeeze it out. Starting tomorrow, I can no longer guarantee daily updates, readers don't need to wait at 10am...However, in September, I will update intermittently until completion. Again, thank you readers for accompanying me all the way, thank you ~</p>

        <h1>Chapter 781</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Another fifty years passed, and Feng Cheng sent a message again: "Master Wei, Master Ya Shan, I seem to have discovered another life-bearing planet."</p><p></p><p>This time, not only was Ya Shan stunned, but even Su Hao was very surprised as he looked at Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan couldn't help but ask: "Feng Cheng, do you have some secret exploration method? Why is it always you who finds them? Two or three times is understandable, but four or five times in a row!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also nodded and said: "Feng Cheng, come to my lab sometime and let me study whether you have some kind of invincible cosmic emperor's luck!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "I think we really need to dissect you."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately waved his hand and said: "What luck? Master Wei is right, this is completely a matter of probability!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan found this reasonable, and after pondering for a moment said: "Or should we switch back?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately nodded: "Switch, we must switch. Next time Master Ya Shan will definitely discover the life-bearing planet first!"</p><p></p><p>The three of them began to explore this planet.</p><p></p><p>There was no intelligent life...</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao discovered a few special animals on this planet.</p><p></p><p>The closer ones could accurately locate their nests from hundreds of kilometers away, while the farther ones could even locate globally.</p><p></p><p>After careful observation and perception, Su Hao confirmed it was different from the normal positive and negative magnetic fields of a planet.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be some kind of planetary force field I've never seen before?"</p><p></p><p>After five years of investigation, Su Hao discovered two 'seeker' substances, named 'Seeker 195' and 'Seeker 196', and through these two seekers, discovered two kinds of planetary force fields.</p><p></p><p>Three years later, referring to those special animals and using 'Seeker 196', Su Hao successfully created a 'spiritual eye'.</p><p></p><p>It was called the 'Planetary Spiritual Eye'.</p><p></p><p>Its effect was extremely powerful - it could directly observe the entire appearance of a planet, enveloping the whole planet in perception like a divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>However, its precision was low. It could accurately locate a specific location, but could not clearly perceive the objects on it, not even distinguishing human shapes.</p><p></p><p>But it still made Su Hao very excited, as this was his first ability to directly observe an entire planet.</p><p></p><p>This ability was different from what he had seen in the 'Planetary Network' - the planets seen there were essentially just from a 'perspective' view.</p><p></p><p>Whereas the Planetary Spiritual Eye could envelop the entire planet like a divine consciousness - they were not the same concept.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Another hundred years passed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao finally discovered a life-bearing planet before Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>This relieved him, confirming that it had nothing to do with luck, and was related to probability...</p><p></p><p>After researching it, Su Hao obtained a new neural system structure from the large organisms on this planet that was superior to the human neural structure.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thirty years later, Feng Cheng discovered a life-bearing planet.</p><p></p><p>On it, Su Hao obtained an optimized energy structure, greatly enhancing the power of his spirit force grid.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years later, Su Hao discovered a life-bearing planet.</p><p></p><p>And on this planet, he obtained a special protein cell membrane structure, which gave rise to a strange idea in his mind: Perhaps I could replace all the cell membranes in my body with spirit force - wouldn't that allow me to access more spirit force with my body?</p><p></p><p>Let me try it.</p><p></p><p>Failure, failure, failure...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "Every time it's a failed success - the hardest part is distinguishing beneficial substances from viruses. I'll shelve this project for now and wait until I gain more knowledge in the future."</p><p></p><p>Another seventy years later, Feng Cheng discovered a life-bearing planet.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan was about to cry.</p><p></p><p>"Master Wei, Feng Cheng, can you two teach me how to find life-bearing planets!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao consoled him: "Keep going Ya Shan, I believe the next planet will be found by you."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also encouraged him: "That's right Master Ya Shan, this is simply a matter of probability. Perhaps the direction you've been exploring just doesn't happen to have life-bearing planets."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "But I've switched with you many times, and every time after switching it's you who finds one. How do you explain that?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "Coincidence...so, Master Ya Shan, do you want to switch this time or not?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan immediately fell into an extremely conflicted state, like guessing heads or tails on a coin flip - every time he guessed heads, it came up tails, and every time he guessed tails, it came up heads. He was utterly perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Ya Shan waved his hand decisively: "No switching. I don't believe I can't find one."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ya Shan asked: "Master Wei, Feng Cheng, when you two are searching, do you have an expressionless face or a slight smile? I feel like maybe my expression is wrong."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng quipped: "Last time you said it was your posture that was wrong..."</p><p></p><p>Time flew by rapidly, and five thousand years passed.</p><p></p><p>The three of them explored countless galaxies, and discovered all kinds of life-bearing planets in many galaxies, including many that had developed civilizations.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on these planets they harvested various strange little abilities and knowledge to continuously optimize their own ability systems.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, in the Billiard Dimension, Su Hao recorded a vast amount of information - any strange phenomena or substances were crammed into it without exception.</p><p></p><p>For him, many phenomena and substances he couldn't understand now might suddenly make sense in the future.</p><p></p><p>Better to record something wrong than to miss anything.</p><p></p><p>Of course, during these thousands of years, most of the time was spent on the journey of exploration itself, with not much time actually spent stopping to conduct research.</p><p></p><p>After all, although they explored quite a few life-bearing planets over these years, there were not many useful findings.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, among all these civilized planets, there was not a single humanoid intelligent species...</p><p></p><p>Their appearances were all bizarre creatures - what were essentially large-headed aquatic tribes, bird tribes, small underground sprites, tentacle monsters...</p><p></p><p>The civilizations developed by such intelligent species looked simply indescribable to the human Su Hao...</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng kept exclaiming in amazement: "I never imagined these weird things could also develop intelligence and civilization. I always thought only humans had a greater probability of developing civilization - I considered the Octopus Tribe an exception. Who could have guessed that all kinds of different species in the universe could develop intelligence?"</p><p></p><p>Since Ya Shan found far fewer life-bearing planets than Feng Cheng, he had long been depressed about it, so he took this opportunity to disdainfully glance at Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng didn't seem at all like someone who had lived for thousands of years...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps without the scheming and interpersonal dealings, time alone does not age one's mentality. Or perhaps mentality and physical state are closely linked.</p><p></p><p>In any case, at over six thousand years old, Su Hao and the others were still able to maintain a youthful and vigorous mentality.</p><p></p><p>As for the time it took them to find life-bearing planets, there was no set pattern.</p><p></p><p>The shortest was ten years to find one, the longest was five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>It was completely a matter of probability.</p><p></p><p>And in Su Hao's view, there was no discernible pattern to the birth of life-bearing planets.</p><p></p><p>If one had to say the emergence of life was related to something, then it would have to be 'coincidence'.</p><p></p><p>Over these years, they discovered innumerable planets suitable for the emergence and proliferation of life, but so many habitable planets were barren.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao even felt that many planets didn't need to be terraformed - if a large chunk of soil containing plants was transplanted from other life-bearing planets, countless years later, those planets would inevitably develop rich species too.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a plan gradually took shape in Su Hao's mind: It was such a pity that these habitable planets had no life flourishing on them. Perhaps he could sow the seeds of life and wait for them to sprout and grow in the future.</p><p></p><p>Sow a seed in spring, reap a harvest in autumn.</p><p></p><p>Of course, by 'seeds of life' he didn't mean transplanting organisms from other planets, but rather designing a 'life form' according to his own imagination and then releasing it onto planets to observe its evolutionary state.</p><p></p><p>But the timing wasn't ripe yet.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel my physical body gradually aging. Perhaps if I persevere for another two thousand years, it will completely decay and I'll die. Even if I sow the seeds of life now, I likely won't live to see the harvest."</p><p></p><p>Eight thousand years was indeed an extremely long lifespan...</p><p></p><p>But on the cosmic scale, it still seemed too short.</p><p></p><p>That day, Su Hao called Ya Shan and Feng Cheng back.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "We've been exploring outwards for six thousand years now. I don't know how human civilization in the Cloud Ring System has developed, so I plan to go back and take a look. Do you two want to come along?"</p><p></p><p>In six thousand years, the three had explored who knows how many galaxies, yet the galaxies they traveled through were just a tiny speck in the observable universe...</p><p></p><p>Even if they continued outwards for the remaining two thousand years, they couldn't go much further.</p><p></p><p>The exploration of the cosmos had only just begun.</p><p></p><p>When Ya Shan and Feng Cheng heard this, they immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they could return to human society and indulge for a while.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, even opening treasure chests would get stale.</p><p></p><p>That's it for today, it should be around 200,000 words now~ The first time I've written such a long novel, just thinking about it feels unbelievable. I sincerely thank the legitimate readers for their subscriptions and ticket support~ This theme should have been good, but I didn't write it well enough. I can only say I'll learn from the experience and keep working hard going forward~</p>

        <h1>Chapter 992</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After the infinite land was built, the development of things was not much different from what Su Hao had imagined.</p><p></p><p>This piece of land served perfectly as their core base. Over time, it would continue to expand outward.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, there was no so-called boundary.</p><p></p><p>And the various scattered knowledge on the infinite land, after so many years of communication, had indeed developed into something different from Su Hao's current application direction.</p><p></p><p>In other words, almost every few years, Su Hao could harvest some new applications from the infinite land, greatly expanding his mindset.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful one's brain is, its breadth cannot match that of billions of ordinary creatures' brains. After all, the old saying goes well: When the forest is big, there are all kinds of birds; when the bird is big, it goes to all kinds of forests.</p><p></p><p>For a long time, Su Hao has maintained a humble and progressive heart, and now is no exception.</p><p></p><p>He would not think that he knows everything on this infinite land.</p><p></p><p>The miracles of nature's evolution are beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Taking the infinite land as the center of the universe and exploring outward, this is the right way for me to explore the universe. After the infinite land was built, my speed of gain far exceeded the past, which is what I wanted.</p><p></p><p>How beautiful and exquisite are the miracles and treasures hidden in the universe, I can discover them one by one."</p><p></p><p>If they had only relied on the three of them from the beginning, they might not have made much progress by now, but rather stagnated in the old knowledge system.</p><p></p><p>And this is precisely what Su Hao least wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>If his mind and consciousness lost their pursuit and vitality, what would be the meaning of such a long life?</p><p></p><p>So-called eternal life, so-called power, so-called knowledge, none of them can conceal the emptiness deep in the soul.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao absolutely would not allow himself to become such a walking corpse.</p><p></p><p>"I am Su Hao, an ordinary person pursuing infinite knowledge in the infinite universe. I believe there will be endless miracles in the universe, and I will find them."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao silently recited this sentence, then wrote it at the top of the most prominent log board in the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>He hoped to always remember this sentence and not let it degenerate.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao rarely self-reflected: "Has my pursuit changed all this time?"</p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head resolutely: "My original intention has never changed, and will not change. I just want to eternally, freely, and safely explore the universe, witness the miracles of the universe, and seek the unknown of the universe."</p><p></p><p>This process is solitary, but life is inherently solitary from birth, which is the characteristic of intelligent beings.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao suddenly thought of Ya Shan and Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>"Will Ya Shan and Feng Cheng follow me all the way to the endless future?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao hoped they would always follow him, because in the distant future, suddenly one day when he wanted to look back, at least there would be people to share the past with him.</p><p></p><p>However, whether Ya Shan and Feng Cheng would follow him forever was not up to him to decide, it was up to them.</p><p></p><p>If one day they lost their way and were full of despair for their infinite lives, planning to end themselves, Su Hao would also respect their choice.</p><p></p><p>He just hoped that day would not come.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, Su Hao exited the pinball space and returned to his main body.</p><p></p><p>Then he sent a message to Ya Shan and Feng Cheng: "Ya Shan, Feng Cheng, I'm back to my main body, let's go out for a walk together."</p><p></p><p>Now that he had studied the 'equilibrium run line' quite deeply, Su Hao was no longer worried about his main body going out and being attacked for no reason.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly wanted to have an in-depth chat with Ya Shan and Feng Cheng in person.</p><p></p><p>Since they had encountered risks in the distant future, if possible, these risks needed to be nipped in the bud in advance.</p><p></p><p>As long as they were mentally prepared, they would not easily become disappointed with the future. Without too much disappointment, they could maintain a relatively balanced mind and be less likely to become desperate.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took Ya Shan and Feng Cheng wandering aimlessly in space, eventually ending up at the initial Ten Cross Stars of this world.</p><p></p><p>The three of them walked to the seaside of the Cloud Mountain Range, found a flat place and sat down, gazing into the distant sea.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao suddenly laughed: "Ya Shan, Feng Cheng, do you still remember what you looked like when you were about to die of old age in your previous life?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were stunned, not understanding why Su Hao brought this up. They recalled and couldn't help but smile and nod: "Of course we remember."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan also said: "Feng Cheng, you little guy, it was your first time getting old. I could sense the despair and sadness from your expression. You even said your heart had aged and you couldn't get excited about young ladies anymore. Haha, thinking about it now, it was quite amusing.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, I haven't seen Feng Cheng go play with girls for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said with some embarrassment: "Sometimes there is some interest, but when it really comes to it, it feels a bit bland. After that, I stopped looking for girls. Generally speaking, discovering wondrous planets is more interesting."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the body slowly aging can indeed make one's heart fill with fear, even the powerful Ya Shan and Feng Cheng could not escape this.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "When you died back then, did you ever think that you would never be able to wake up again? Did you ever think that your knowledge, power, desires and efforts, everything, would turn into nothingness? In this universe, you wouldn't leave anything behind. The universe would still be the same universe, but we would be gone."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's words completely brought them back to the past.</p><p></p><p>The first time Ya Shan died was when he risked everything as the head of the 'Temple Forest Society', using his own life force to use the unique 'Decay' skill of the 【Destiny Child】 to greatly reduce Su Hao's main body that had transformed into a 【God】, in order to protect his people, eventually exhausting his life force and dying.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he definitely didn't think about this question!</p><p></p><p>The second time Ya Shan died was from natural aging. It was then that he truly contemplated what death meant.</p><p></p><p>The third time he died was when he followed Su Hao without hesitation towards the self-destructing asteroid, and this was also Feng Cheng's first death. Feng Cheng probably didn't think too much about it at that time.</p><p></p><p>The fourth time they died after that, they were still playing poker, which was probably the most uneventful, just instantly gone.</p><p></p><p>Then, after living for eight thousand years and gaining a long lifespan and great power, they still could not escape the fate of decay.</p><p></p><p>It was also this time that Ya Shan and Feng Cheng truly became fearful of death.</p><p></p><p>Because by then, they had acquired power and knowledge that ordinary people could not possess, and had made many efforts for survival.</p><p></p><p>Eight thousand years of effort, almost without a moment's rest.</p><p></p><p>Yet in the end, they still could not escape the shadow of death.</p><p></p><p>The more effort they put in, the more they feared that these efforts would turn to nothing, and they began to doubt: "What is the meaning of all I've done in the end?"</p><p></p><p>After death, there really would be nothing.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even the concept of 'nothingness' would not exist...</p><p></p><p>It was this fear that made them cherish Su Hao even more.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan nodded: "I did think about it, but I should have died long ago. Now I've been able to witness many unimaginable miracles, so I'm already content. Facing death, facing 'nothingness', there is just some fear that I can't overcome. Other than that, I don't have too many regrets.</p><p></p><p>If I have to say I have regrets..."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan fell silent here.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng curiously asked, "Old Master Ya Shan, what other regrets do you have?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "All of this that I've witnessed, my wife, my children, they couldn't accompany me and witness my happiness with me."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he couldn't help but laugh: "Fortunately, there is Old Master Wei who can witness all this, and of course you too, Feng Cheng."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded: "Me too, when I followed Old Master Wei to self-destruct back then, I didn't think too much about it. I just didn't expect that I could wake up again. After waking up, I often wondered if those people we protected managed to survive, but unfortunately I can no longer see them. Other than that, I don't think I have any regrets.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... because the people I cherish have always been by my side - Old Master Wei and Old Master Ya Shan. Other people are no different to me!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed: "You two don't have many regrets, but I have many. There were many things I wanted to do in the past but couldn't. Now I have the ability, but I can never go back."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng asked, "Is it because you don't know where the planets we've been to are?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "That's right, I don't know where the planets we visited before are located. In fact, I don't even know where the region of the universe we're currently in is located. Or maybe in the future we'll find planets we've been to before, but after going through vicissitudes, we may not recognize them anymore.</p><p></p><p>The past is just some information stored in our memories."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "In the future, we will encounter countless people and things, and this information will keep accumulating in our memories, more and more, until it completely covers up the past.</p><p></p><p>I'm not even sure if in the distant future, we will forget our origins, forget our past, forget that we were once afraid of death.</p><p></p><p>Don't doubt it, with our current technology, we can live that long.</p><p></p><p>Until planets are destroyed and stars collapse, we may still be alive, one billion years, trillions of years, billions of billions of years.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing such a long time, will we still remember the joys and sorrows when we were weak?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng uncontrollably imagined what they would look like billions of billions of years later.</p><p></p><p>However, this advanced soul brain failed to simulate their appearance at that time...</p><p></p><p>Such a long period of time had already exceeded the limits of this brain's imagination. At this moment, they once again felt a deep sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>As for whether they would still remember their origins at that time, they were also uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Most likely, they would not remember!</p><p></p><p>In the past, they were still striving hard to pursue eternal life, without the qualifications to think about this question.</p><p></p><p>Now that they have obtained eternal life, they have to face this profound question.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan couldn't help but turn to look at Su Hao, his all-powerful Old Master Wei: "Old Master Wei, I feel that after an extremely long time, I will definitely get lost. What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't think he had an 'eternal heart' as tenacious and indestructible as Old Master Wei's.</p><p></p><p>In the distant future, he would gradually become lost and eventually self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan didn't want to lose all this, nor did he want to lose his Old Master Wei.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also stared blankly at Su Hao, waiting for his answer.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao just smiled, then said lightly, "Delete useless information, keep what you think is precious. As long as you don't let the cumbersome information of the future cover up the things we cherish, it'll be fine.</p><p></p><p>During this period, I suddenly realized that our soul brains are not perfect, but rather have a major flaw - they cannot automatically forget some irrelevant things like normal human brains.</p><p></p><p>So, we need to set up an automatic deletion program to help us periodically clear out the excess information in our soul brains.</p><p></p><p>In addition, we need to ask ourselves: What is my eternal ideal?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng looked at each other, and said in unison: "My eternal ideal is to follow Old Master Wei and explore the endless universe."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "Then, always remember this sentence. As long as you don't forget it, you will never get lost eternally."</p><p></p><p>"Believe me, I, your Old Master Wei, will not get lost in eternity."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, when someone says 'I will never forget this sentence' or 'I will never forget this day', forgetting is not far away.</p><p></p><p>For example, that post on Penguin Space ten years ago, or that tearful cry posted on Moments.</p><p></p><p>When looking back, perhaps it has already been forgotten...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had a deep understanding of this.</p><p></p><p>For example, if he didn't review the ancient records of the pinball space now, he would have forgotten that life as Su Hao - what he had experienced, what hardships had left an indelible mark, or which girl had hurt him to the core...</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he didn't even remember the names of the people who owed him money.</p><p></p><p>The past seemed to dissipate like a wisp of smoke, leaving nothing behind.</p><p></p><p>But forgetting did not prevent him from loving those who had smiled at him, nor did it prevent him from hating those who had hurt him.</p><p></p><p>In summary: I love all the people and things that were kind to me in the past, and I'm grateful; I hate all the people and things that maliciously hurt me, and I have never forgiven them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that's not the point. The point is, Su Hao wanted to truly remember the things he didn't want to forget.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I have another way that can make you never forget the past."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng asked in surprise, "What method?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao showed a brilliant smile: "I thought of it, but I haven't figured it out yet."</p>

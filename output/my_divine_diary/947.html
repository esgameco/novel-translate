        <h1>Chapter 947</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After giving the deities instructions, Su Hao left the Crossroads Star and returned to the experimental base.</p><p></p><p>He first entered the pinball space and reviewed the information uploaded by Yashan and Fengcheng over the years to understand the current situation.</p><p></p><p>"Progress is fast. I didn't expect that after just proposing the concept, Yashan has already helped me handle the beginning and end. So, the Infinite Land Plan can be implemented now."</p><p></p><p>He immediately messaged Yashan and Fengcheng, summoning the two to his experimental base.</p><p></p><p>When Yashan and Fengcheng saw Su Hao, they seemed very excited and gave a simple report on what they had done over the years.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Su Hao smiled happily, "I originally thought I would have to design a way to connect different worlds together after coming out of seclusion, but you two have already solved the key problems.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, after I review the detailed designs, I can start executing this plan, building and adjusting simultaneously until it's completely stable."</p><p></p><p>The two immediately replied, "Yes, Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>In fact, they had already prepared the personnel and resources, just waiting for Su Hao's order to launch the entire massive project.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were still many small details that needed Su Hao's confirmation, which would require adjustments after he reviewed the final designs.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Yashan and Fengcheng took Su Hao to a planet, which was the center of the simulated Infinite Land they had built on barren planets over the years.</p><p></p><p>While touring, the two explained the details of the massive engineering project to Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long to tour the entire simulated Infinite Land.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After returning, Yashan and Fengcheng conscientiously prepared a sumptuous meal for Su Hao, and the three chatted while enjoying the food.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also mentioned what he had done during his seclusion over the years.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng curiously asked, "Master Wei, you were in seclusion for nearly 500 years. Was the 'Equilibrium Circuit' that difficult?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually took out two 'Invisibility Coins' and handed one each to Yashan and Fengcheng, saying, "The difficulty can't be called great, but the process of exploring from nothing inevitably takes time. After truly cracking it, I found it wasn't that difficult."</p><p></p><p>The two took the coins and observed them from a microscopic level with their divine consciousness, but after a long time, they didn't find anything special and looked at Su Hao puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "This is called the 'Invisibility Coin'. I named it the 'Coin Lost by the Goddess of Fortune'. Carrying it can offset the effects of luck on us, preventing us from being attacked by misfortune. Of course, correspondingly, good luck will also be eliminated."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were shocked, staring at the coin in amazement, unable to imagine that such a small thing could actually influence a person's luck.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "You could say that the success of this coin has advanced my equipment manufacturing capabilities to another dimension. With this method, many of our existing devices can be updated and replaced.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, there are no apparent abnormalities from the outside."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng hadn't been so surprised in a long time. They knew Su Hao wasn't lying because even they couldn't detect any abnormalities in the coin - they probably wouldn't even look at it if it was lying on the road.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed at the coins in their hands with a mysterious smile, "In fact, the structure of this coin is similar to the 'Blue Crystal Star Key' in our bodies used to access the 'Starry Network'."</p><p></p><p>The two understood. Just like how they used the blue crystal - if it weren't for the special nature of the Compound Eye race, perhaps no one would have known its function.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao briefly explained the principle of the coin to them and said, "You can look up the details in the records, including some of my experimental insights. However, these coins are very difficult to make - you can try it yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng curiously asked, "Can this coin increase luck?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao replied, "Not for now, it can only offset excess energy influences. But if we can use a large amount of data to analyze the information models of 'misfortune' and 'luck', we may be able to artificially control luck."</p><p></p><p>At this point, he laughed and shook his head, "But for now, the difficulty is immense. With the ever-changing universe, these two models are not easy to grasp. To master them may take millions or tens of millions of years."</p><p></p><p>Even so, Yashan and Fengcheng couldn't help but be amazed by Su Hao's creations.</p><p></p><p>Now that even 'luck' could be interfered with, what was impossible?</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Two years later.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao transmitted to the planet where Cao Shilang was and quickly browsed through Cao Shilang's experiences over the past two years while observing the surrounding circuits.</p><p></p><p>Everything was normal.</p><p></p><p>This also indirectly proved the good effect of the Invisibility Coin.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao appeared beside Cao Shilang, watching him build sandcastles like a child, and smiled, "Not a bad sandcastle, you have architectural talent. Would you like to leave this place with me, or stay here and build sandcastles?"</p><p></p><p>When Cao Shilang saw Su Hao, he cried tears of joy, big drops rolling down his face. He opened his mouth, "Ah ba ah ba~ I...I want to leave, please take me away!"</p><p></p><p>The poor kid couldn't even speak clearly.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately took him away and, thinking it over, directly handed him to the eighteen deities to teach him how to control his body.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed deities, I've come to see you again. How is the observation task I assigned you progressing?"</p><p></p><p>Nati exclaimed in amazement, "That Coin of the Goddess of Fortune is too miraculous. The world wills holding the coin haven't suffered any inexplicable attacks. In the past two years, apart from the tasks we arranged, there has been no danger - very stable."</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bali asked, "Lord Jiayue, can we exchange for the coins?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately refused, "Not for now. You have no need for that thing. It's a product prepared for the world wills. If you want it, you'll have to wait until after further improvements."</p><p></p><p>The deities looked very disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed at Cao Shilang beside him, "You've worked hard these two years. I'll reward each of you with two thousand points. Additionally, I've brought you a little brother - he was once a member of the world will you protected. I unintentionally discovered and revived him. He has a body like yours but doesn't know how to use it yet."</p><p></p><p>The deities all looked at Cao Shilang in surprise.</p><p></p><p>They inwardly muttered, "Why does this guy look so timid, without any of the silly cleverness of a world will?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao turned to Cao Shilang, "Your name is Cao Shilang, right? From now on, you'll learn from these eighteen elder brothers and sisters how to..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang didn't hesitate, immediately kneeling to kowtow to Su Hao, "Thank you...Lord Jiayue for recreating me. Cao Shilang will never forget this kindness."</p><p></p><p>Then he turned to the eighteen deities and bowed, "Little brother Cao Shilang greets you all, elder brothers and sisters. From now on, little Cao will listen to you elders' every command without objection."</p><p></p><p>He had had enough of the two years of solitude. As long as he could leave that ghostly place, what did it matter to have a few elder brothers and sisters?</p><p></p><p>Who hasn't been a younger brother in life?</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities looked at each other. Just like that, they had gained a little brother?</p><p></p><p>The group chat instantly exploded.</p><p></p><p>"What can this little brother do?"</p><p></p><p>"Serve tea and pour water, probably?"</p><p></p><p>"Do I look like someone who needs others to serve tea and pour water?"</p><p></p><p>"I think he's useless too, he might even become our burden."</p><p></p><p>"I think he can at least run errands - let him help with all the miscellaneous tasks! And when we go out, we can bring him along to add some presence."</p><p></p><p>"One little brother for eighteen of us, to add presence?"</p><p></p><p>"It's better than nothing. The key is, this little brother was designated by Lord Jiayue. Do you have any objections?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>So the deities temporarily accepted this extra "little brother" Cao Shilang.</p>

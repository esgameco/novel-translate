        <h1>Chapter 956</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled and said, "I think the current screening mechanism for the first generation of Primordial Gods is not bad. I plan to temporarily keep the current mechanism unchanged, and later expand the scale, giving some indicators to my subordinates and letting them solve this problem themselves."</p><p></p><p>"Only by constantly adjusting through practice can we achieve the best results."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng's eyes lit up, "That makes sense. With so many disciples, I can have them share some of the work for me."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed heartily, "In that case, you might as well go to the Blue-Purple Star and have professional designers directly come up with a solution for you."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "What Yashan said also makes sense..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought for a moment and said, "Regarding the screening mechanism issue, through over a thousand years of observation, I have found that the trial scenarios in reality have certain limitations. Many suitable scenarios cannot be set up, so I plan to adopt a 'reality + virtual' method to build the trial worlds in the future. General trial scenarios will be sent directly to the Infinite Land, while special trial scenarios will be completed in the virtual world."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were surprised, "Where can we get a virtual world? Our current technological level can't reach such a completely realistic degree yet!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "There are two 'inner worlds' in the Soul Network - the Celestial Palace and the Underworld. After more than a thousand years of development, these two inner worlds have now gathered many powerful sacred spirits. I plan to readjust these two inner worlds in coordination with the micro-worlds to achieve a 99% realistic degree, and then transfer some of the trial worlds into these two inner worlds."</p><p></p><p>"Most importantly, many sacred spirits in the Celestial Palace and the Underworld can assist me in adjusting and maintaining the trial worlds."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng knew about these two inner worlds, but they were not in charge of those projects and did not know much about them.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "But Master Wei, no matter how high the degree of realism, it is still a virtual world after all, and it will inevitably show its flaws."</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "With your strength, it's natural that you can detect the problems. But not everyone has the ability to detect what's wrong."</p><p></p><p>"The newcomers participating in the trials will be placed in the trial scenarios in the inner worlds first. When these newcomers grow to a certain level, they will then be sent to the Infinite Land."</p><p></p><p>"In this way, they will not notice anything amiss."</p><p></p><p>The two were greatly moved.</p><p></p><p>Suhao saw their thoughts and said, "If you two also want to create virtual trial scenarios, I can create an inner world for each of you. Now that the Soul Network has expanded, it should be able to support the operation of four inner worlds."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng immediately said happily, "Thank you, Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "This way, many of my ideas can be realized."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "You two can work on it yourselves next. I need to take some time to digest the new knowledge you have explored. There are many fresh things on those life planets, which may bring me a lot of inspiration."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Suhao found the eighteen deities and Cao Shilang, informing them of his plan to expand the scale of the first generation of Primordial Gods.</p><p></p><p>Nati was shocked, "What...what? The wave of the birth of the Will of the World has come again? I didn't expect the Will of the World to be so fertile. Is it because the completion of the Infinite Land has greatly encouraged the world to have multiple births at once..."</p><p></p><p>Bali was also amazed, "This is too surprising."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "You can understand it that way. In any case, my requirements are not difficult. One is to create enough trial scenarios of different levels in the Celestial Palace and the Underworld, and move the early trial tasks into these two inner worlds. The other is to expand the scale of trials and screen suitable trial wills as quickly as possible."</p><p></p><p>"As for how to adjust the first generation of Primordial Gods, you can decide that yourselves. The adjustment authority for the first generation of Primordial Gods has been delegated to you, and you can adjust them freely without breaking the basic framework."</p><p></p><p>"However, I have a minimum requirement for the trial participants - they need to reach the Yuan Ying realm, which is what you usually call the fourth level."</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked, "Do you have confidence in completing the task? If you successfully complete it, I will unlock a new spatial ability called 'Counter-Spatial Barrier' for you for free."</p><p></p><p>The deities all said there would be no problem and promised to complete the task.</p><p></p><p>After Suhao left, the eighteen deities became entangled.</p><p></p><p>They had previously promised the Great Demon King Chipu to make a main machine for the Soul Network.</p><p></p><p>Making the main machine was an extremely complicated and time-consuming task.</p><p></p><p>So the deities began to mutter among themselves.</p><p></p><p>"I think we can put Chipu's matter aside for now. Lord Jiawei's matter is more important."</p><p></p><p>"But can we do this to our friend Chipu? More importantly, we promised Chipu in advance, how can we go back on our word?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, to put it bluntly, Chipu is not the key. The key is that this set of Soul Network main machine completely belongs to us and concerns our own interests. Of course, we should consider our own interests first."</p><p></p><p>"Are you sick in the head? You know it, but why say it out loud?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm just worried that someone might not know."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, hey, didn't you agree to be Lord Jiawei's little follower for ten thousand years before?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course we're not going back on our word, but this doesn't conflict, does it?"</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Eternal Night, Yongshi, smiled faintly, "Indeed, there is no conflict, because Lord Jiawei did not specify a deadline for us to complete this task. The general idea is that whenever we complete it, he will give us the 'Counter-Spatial Barrier' ability."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense. In fact, we can first make the main machine for the Soul System, and then work on solving the issue of the first generation of Primordial Gods. At most, we can delay it for fifty years, which is not a big problem."</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Deity of Order, Hongguang, looked at Cao Shilang and asked, "Little Cao, do you have the authority to modify the first generation of Primordial Gods?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang replied, "Yes..."</p><p></p><p>The deities' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Hongguang asked again, "Did you remember what Lord Jiawei said just now?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang became a bit flustered but still answered truthfully, "Yes, I remember..."</p><p></p><p>Hongguang patted Cao Shilang's shoulder and said, "Then the task of adjusting the first generation of Primordial Gods will be given to you. You must perform well."</p><p></p><p>The deities saw Cao Shilang's expression gradually becoming stiff.</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Bathing Light, Yiwen, said gently, "Didn't you want to learn new things? If you complete this task, we will teach you powerful skills."</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang immediately regained his senses and exclaimed excitedly, "Teleportation?"</p><p></p><p>The deities immediately frowned.</p><p></p><p>Hongguang said, "What are you thinking? You're still young. We'll talk about it when you grow up. Don't worry, you'll learn it eventually. For now, even if we teach you, you won't be able to learn it. It's decided then. Work hard, Little Cao. We believe in you."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the eighteen deities patiently began to explain to Cao Shilang how to adjust the first generation of Primordial Gods and how to ensure the successful growth of the Will of the World, and so on.</p><p></p><p>After the explanation, the eighteen deities left with the words "Find us if you have any questions."</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang fell into a daze again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Create a large number of trial worlds of various levels in the two inner worlds? How am I supposed to do that..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang scratched his head in distress, his face full of perplexity.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was previously just an ordinary "trial participant", one of those who couldn't even survive five worlds before being eliminated.</p><p></p><p>And he admitted that he was indeed a novice...</p><p></p><p>For such a novice like him to suddenly become a high-authority administrator, how could he possibly do as required and create all kinds of advanced "trial worlds"...?</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't just not do the task assigned by the eighteen senior brothers and sisters. Who knows what kind of treatment he would suffer if he didn't obediently complete the task? He currently had no ability to break free from their control.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he met these eighteen senior brothers and sisters, he could sense a kind of inexplicable rejection and disdain from them, so from the very beginning, he was very afraid of the eighteen deities.</p><p></p><p>Compared to these eighteen senior brothers and sisters, if possible, he would prefer to stay by Lord Jiawei's side.</p><p></p><p>He used his system authority to enter the inner world of the Celestial Palace and began browsing through the vast amount of information there, pulling out a tuft of hair from his head as he browsed. But the bald spot quickly grew back.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do? This is so difficult..."</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, he suddenly had a brilliant idea, and his eyes lit up, "Oh~ If it's like this, it might just work..."</p>

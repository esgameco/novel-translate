        <div class="content">
            <p>以下是对这段中文小说片段的英文翻译:</p><p></p><p>"Wind Cheng?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Ya Shan?"</p><p></p><p>The two looked dumbfounded. Just a moment ago they were playing cards, but in the blink of an eye, they had changed locations and appearances.</p><p></p><p>More bizarre than teleportation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the power within them was gone! Their minds had also become dull - they were now just ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Wei?"</p><p></p><p>They both looked towards Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>It was an unfamiliar handsome face, also changed into another appearance. But through his expression and eyes, they could confirm this was indeed their Elder Wei.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan slowly stood up and checked his current situation. He suddenly realized that once again, he had been reincarnated following Elder Wei!</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan tried to recall, "We were just playing cards on the spaceship, then suddenly felt the ship shake, and then..."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng nodded repeatedly, "Yes, yes, yes! Then what?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan spread his hands and shook his head, "I don't know!"</p><p></p><p>After the two adapted for a while, Su Hao directly said, "Then after that, you died. The ship encountered a high-frequency particle flow and was destroyed. I didn't last much longer either before bringing your souls to this new world."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng exclaimed in admiration, "Souls? Elder Wei, you can control souls? So powerful! So that's how I was revived in my previous life!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed, "Otherwise, who did you think Elder Wei was? Elder Wei is destined to conquer the universe!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng asked in disbelief, "You mean, even if I die now, as long as Elder Wei is here, I can still be revived?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head, "Not necessarily. Perhaps one day after death, you'll truly die and dissipate into nothingness, unable to think anymore. So don't let yourselves die easily, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Elder Wei."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "You two need to quickly recover your powers. I have some research projects here that will need your assistance."</p><p></p><p>The difficulty in recovering their powers lay in restoring their spiritual energy, not their blood energy or spiritual power - those energies could be directly converted from the source.</p><p></p><p>But to basically recover their spiritual energy would take at least a year.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan rubbed his hands together eagerly, "The blood is burning again, able to explore the world once more following Elder Wei! Elder Wei, rest assured, I'm ready anytime!"</p><p></p><p>Then he casually slapped Wind Cheng, "You brat, what are you looking around for? Say a few words of rebirth!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng came to his senses and bumped fists, "Right!"</p><p></p><p>He said solemnly, "From this moment on, I will study harder and strive to become a researcher! That way, I can be a good assistant to you two elders. Yes, I'll work hard!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan asked, "Not going to the Music Immortal Palace anymore?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng waved his hand dismissively, "No more. The beauties are just illusory skeletons. From now on, I'll listen to you two elders."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Seeing you two so full of vigor, I'm reassured. Then starting today, you'll be responsible for maintaining the new base, while also beginning to learn the language of this new world!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Wind Cheng's expressions changed drastically as they stammered, "Learn...a new language?"</p><p></p><p>The curiosity about the world that had just arisen was suppressed again.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! That's too hard!"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Wei, why don't you just swap our brains first? I feel like my brain isn't working well right now!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, when thinking, there's obvious lag, searching information is extremely slow, and I can't recall many formulas and theorems!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "I told you, don't record important things in your mind-space, it's just an aid, not the foundation. Now it's good, after changing worlds and starting over, you have to relearn many things.</p><p></p><p>Alright, first find a place to stay here and adapt to your new bodies. In a couple days I'll modify your brains a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful!" The two had tears of excitement in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Learning a new language was torture for them every time.</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the language issue, Su Hao suddenly thought of the brain splicing structure of the Mother Bug - could this splicing mode directly implant a language set into the brain?</p><p></p><p>If it could be done, then in the future when traveling the universe and encountering intelligent life, language would no longer be an obstacle to communication.</p><p></p><p>"We'll talk about that later, one step at a time, first get the current tasks done properly."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With Ya Shan and Wind Cheng joining, Su Hao's small world became lively.</p><p></p><p>The two inherited some changes from their new bodies, becoming less calm than their previous selves and more unrestrained, with a youthful vigor.</p><p></p><p>The consciousness affects the flesh, and the flesh in turn affects the consciousness, the two influencing each other.</p><p></p><p>For example, if a top talent's consciousness information was stuffed into an idiot's brain, not to mention the mismatch, but besides their superior thinking methods, their thinking speed and memory would likely plummet to a terrifying low.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying to even contemplate!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao first took time to buy the two a bunch of daily necessities, then designed the "Seer" gene for them and modified their faces.</p><p></p><p>At their strong insistence, he modified them to look similar to their previous selves.</p><p></p><p>Another month passed, and Ya Shan and Wind Cheng's faces had completely changed, becoming two diligent maintenance workers at the small world base, responsible for installing and adjusting the various machinery brought in.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Hao, arranged by the Captain, he became an intern researcher, embodying ten thousand "whys", entering the research institute to study under the veteran scholars.</p><p></p><p>He focused on studying curvature engines and long-range communication technologies.</p><p></p><p>In just three months, aided by a large amount of materials, he grasped the structure and principles of the curvature engine quite well, causing the senior scholar guiding him to call him a prodigy and constantly exclaim that the human research field had gained another leader-level successor!</p><p></p><p>After learning the structure and principles of the curvature engine, Su Hao didn't rush to try manifesting it with his own abilities. Instead, he transferred to another research group to study communication technology.</p><p></p><p>This time, having laid the foundation of various formulas and symbols in the previous three months, Su Hao completed the learning task in just one month.</p><p></p><p>He then transferred to another research group to study materials science.</p><p></p><p>Then transferred again to study mechanical design.</p><p></p><p>Then transferred again...</p><p></p><p>Thus, the rumor that the superhero Xu Shiqiang was actually a super research genius somehow spread, causing another stir among humanity.</p><p></p><p>There were also rumors that the "Supernatural Power Method" recently promoted in the military was also developed by the superhero Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>For a time, Xu Shiqiang became the object of admiration for almost everyone.</p><p></p><p>A person's strength could reach such a degree, it was astonishing.</p><p></p><p>Many people felt moved, "Perhaps Xu Shiqiang is the savior arranged by heaven for humanity. He must be able to lead humanity to ultimate victory in the war against the Eight-Armed Race."</p><p></p><p>Leader Xia Qingjun was furious when Su Hao's information leaked out and ordered a thorough investigation of the research institute. The researcher who leaked the information was immediately fired and added to the organization's untrustworthy list, no longer trusted by any major company.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also delighted inwardly, because this proved Su Hao's ability. Materializing "teleportation" with machinery was no longer a dream, but an achievable goal.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had only tried it with the mentality of giving it a shot - even if it failed, it wouldn't be a big problem. But now he looked forward to it immensely, hoping that in ten years, Su Hao could give him a good result.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the Captain's status was raised again as he was transferred from the Yuanxing Ship to become the dedicated communicator between the organization and Su Hao, trying his best to satisfy Su Hao's various strange requests.</p><p></p><p>Because in Su Hao, they saw the hope for humanity's future.</p><p></p><p>As for the Yuanxing Ship, a new captain was promoted from the secondary officers, with plans to carry out another patrol mission in two years.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by as Su Hao studied.</p><p></p><p>A year passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao completed his internship at the research institute and officially left, returning to the small world.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't learn everything thoroughly, he had recorded everything he studied in the bouncing realm.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to slowly digest it later, integrating it into his own knowledge system until he fully comprehended and made it his own knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Now, staying at the research institute could no longer provide him with more.</p><p></p><p>What he needed was to return to the small world and conduct various experiments, using his own abilities to turn knowledge into power.</p><p></p><p>For example, his physical body traveling the universe at superluminal speeds; or breaking away from the bouncing realm to achieve long-distance mental communication; or large-scale space interference techniques; or a body enhancement agent to give Realmlords longer lifespans again; or using this world's intelligent information technology to further upgrade Xiao Guang and Xiao Hei...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had learned many technologies, but all of them required machinery to implement - they weren't completely his own yet.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely at this time that the machinery Su Hao had customized was ready.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent! First, I'll make a 'Star-Shattering Cube' to give to Xia Qingjun to try on an Eight-Armed colonial planet. Let him see my value, and my threat."</p><p></p><p>If a person only had value but no force, they would likely become a tool manipulated by others.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, if a person only had force but no value, they would probably be labeled a "great demon" and treated as a villain to be collectively eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this ignores the issue that all "great demons" ultimately get defeated.</p><p></p><p>In summary, to live comfortably, one needs both value and force.</p><p></p><p>"However, before making the Cube, I still need to first create the 'Seeker Ring' and 'Seeker Spirit Eye' to observe the state of the cosmic ripples. After all, the Cube's destructive power is too strong."</p>

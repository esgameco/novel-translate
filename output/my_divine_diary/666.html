        <h1>Chapter 666</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>When everyone was on high alert, Su Hao took the opportunity to secretly examine the firearm in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The overall shape was rectangular. At the muzzle end, there was a 10cm long barrel protruding. The rear stock was designed to fit perfectly with the armor on his body, allowing him to steady his aim and fire comfortably. Below was a long cylindrical device horizontally inserted into the middle of the gun body, looking like a magazine.</p><p></p><p>The location of the trigger was very conspicuous, not much different from common rifles.</p><p></p><p>The most important 'safety' device, Su Hao could see it at a glance. Just a flick of his finger could disengage it, very convenient.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was immediately relieved: "Using this firearm shouldn't be a problem, I just need to observe my comrades' actions at the time."</p><p></p><p>"Only this suit of armor seems to have a built-in power assist system that can aid in combat, but I don't know how to operate it!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Su Hao thought to himself: "With such a strong body, even without using the armor's assist devices, it shouldn't be a big problem. When no one is paying attention to me, I'll try out the functions of the various buttons one by one."</p><p></p><p>While Su Hao was lost in thought, the entire room shook slightly, and then the side hatch opened.</p><p></p><p>The squad leader soldier shouted and waved his finger outwards.</p><p></p><p>The lead soldier didn't even think, immediately sprinting a few steps and leaping out, disappearing from view.</p><p></p><p>Then the second, the third...</p><p></p><p>Soon it was Su Hao's turn, and without hesitation, he took a few running steps.</p><p></p><p>"Patter patter patter~"</p><p></p><p>The armor's built-in auto program recognized and assisted, allowing him to run easily, and then like the others, he leapt outwards.</p><p></p><p>He even had time to think: "The smart program of this armor is not bad, the technological level is quite high, it seems there is hope to further optimize Xiao Guang."</p><p></p><p>After jumping out of the cabin, Su Hao realized that where he had been was actually an enormously huge spacecraft, now hovering at low altitude, with soldiers continuously jumping out from the various open hatches, like dumplings falling down.</p><p></p><p>Then when preparing to land, a powerful jet burst out from under their feet, providing a cushion before they steadily landed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>This was a desolate and monotonous landscape, with scattered rocks several meters high everywhere, just like the various source planets Su Hao had explored in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth button on the side!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's mind was set. As he was about to land, he adjusted his body posture, and then pressed the fourth button.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a powerful impact came from under his feet, drastically reducing his descent speed, allowing him to land steadily on the ground.</p><p></p><p>After landing, the comrades from the same cabin naturally gathered together, forming ranks.</p><p></p><p>With a rough look, Su Hao saw that at least 500 people had jumped off the spacecraft, and their group of twenty was just one small squad.</p><p></p><p>Soon, that squad leader also landed, quickly walking to the front of the formation and giving a low-voiced order.</p><p></p><p>Everyone checked their firearms with a "click click" sound.</p><p></p><p>Then the squad leader opened the mini-computer on his wrist, confirmed the direction, and with a wave of his big hand, took the lead running towards one direction.</p><p></p><p>Quickly, the squad of twenty became just small dots, disappearing among the rubble.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the beginning, Su Hao seemed to adapt very smoothly, his comrades did not notice anything unusual about him.</p><p></p><p>Now that they were running, the squad became more spread out.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also had more opportunities to get used to the armor on his body. Running was effortless, and it worked quite well.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was not knowing the power of the gun in his hand. He really wanted to shoot it at something far away.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao ran with them for nearly five hours, and it seemed they had reached the designated location. The squad slowed down, carefully maneuvering through the piles of rubble, as if wary of something else.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao was hiding behind a large rock, seeing a huge circular military fortress not far away.</p><p></p><p>The fortress had a very peculiar shape, like giant bowls upturned on the ground, densely packed yet very orderly.  </p><p></p><p>There was no wall surrounding it, with flat roads leading straight into the center position, allowing vehicles to drive in freely.</p><p></p><p>All the fortresses emitted a dark luster, looking extremely thick and solid.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, some soldiers could be seen patrolling the roads, while others were stationed at specific locations.</p><p></p><p>Those soldiers...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao squinted his eyes to look, pressing a button on his helmet to automatically adjust the visual aid's focus, and the soldiers' appearances came into view.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Su Hao's eyelids twitched, and he inwardly exclaimed: "Octopuses? These are octopuses, right?"</p><p></p><p>Round heads encased in thick armor, eight tentacles also covered in scales, wrapped tightly like flexible mechanical tentacles.</p><p></p><p>Four tentacles walked steadily and quickly on the ground, while the other four tentacles each held different weapons, calmly aiming to open fire at any time.</p><p></p><p>The level of technology of their armor seemed even higher than the suit Su Hao was wearing, looking like intelligent octopus mechs...</p><p></p><p>This was the first time in all the worlds Su Hao had transmigrated to that he saw armed non-human combat units, feeling very novel.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these tentacled creatures seemed to have very high intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"So these are the so-called aliens? The humans in this world are actually fighting aliens, impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the humans in this world had already entered an era of interstellar warfare.</p><p></p><p>"Which means, I have a chance to obtain all kinds of human high-tech...and the technological level of these octopus tentacle creatures doesn't seem low either. As long as I survive, it will be a huge harvest! I must persevere, don't be rash, survival is the top priority, orders second, mission third!"</p><p></p><p>By now, Su Hao had a rough idea of what this mission was about.</p><p></p><p>It was nothing more than attacking this octopus creature's base, or annihilating the octopus creatures, etc.</p><p></p><p>For him, it was just some fighting and killing games without any real meaning. Give him a few quiet years to cultivate, and how many octopus creatures could he not exterminate?</p><p></p><p>Even without the language barrier, if Su Hao went up and said "Give me five years, I'll return you a world without octopus creatures," he would probably just be seen as an idiot.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The squad was lying in ambush, seemingly waiting for other squads to get into position. </p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before the squad leader seemed to receive the attack order, issuing instructions to allocate tasks. He took the lead to scout ahead, finding a concealed location to set up the firearms, aiming at the distant octopus creatures.</p><p></p><p>The ambush had begun!</p><p></p><p>Their squad's task was simple - use the guns in their hands to shoot and kill any living octopus creature.</p><p></p><p>Advance step-by-step, until this fortress was taken down.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, loud explosions came from afar. Everyone looked over to see clusters of explosions erupting in the forests outside the fortress.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a shrill alarm rang out from the octopus creature's fortress.</p><p></p><p>They immediately realized what had happened - the other squads had been discovered!</p><p></p><p>The squad leader roared and opened fire with his gun.</p><p></p><p>"Zhi!"</p><p></p><p>"Beep--"</p><p></p><p>A beam shot out from the muzzle, straight towards a patrolling octopus creature's large head in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The area hit by the beam exploded violently. The octopus creature was struck by the powerful impact force and fell backwards.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for sure this octopus creature was dead, but unexpectedly it rolled into a ball, taking cover behind an obstacle.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help looking at the gun in his hand, speechless: "A surprise headshot and it's still not dead...what use is this gun?"</p><p></p><p>"Biu biu~" </p><p>"Boom boom boom--"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, gunfire merged into one sound, as the human soldiers launched an all-out attack on the fortress.</p><p></p><p>The originally planned ambush had turned into a siege!</p><p></p><p>The ammunition was energy rounds that traveled in straight trajectories, unlike traditional bullets' parabolic paths, basically allowing them to hit wherever they aimed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's shot had accurately hit the octopus creature's large head, and the point of impact violently exploded, blasting the creature backwards.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao clearly saw it shake its head, then take cover behind an obstacle, raising the weapons on its tentacles to return fire.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, this gun is so trashy, can't even break through their defenses, what's the difference from a toy gun? It doesn't seem as useful as my 'wind bullet' technique."</p><p></p><p>Using toy guns to attack the enemy's military fortress!</p><p></p><p>Which commander slapped their head and came up with this harebrained idea, it's ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>Energy rounds were flying everywhere, explosions ringing incessantly in Su Hao and the others' ears!</p><p></p><p>The octopus creatures' return fire almost had them pinned down, unable to raise their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>A huge explosion sounded next to Su Hao. He glanced towards the blast and saw a soldier's helmet fly high into the air and drop to the side.</p><p></p><p>That soldier was covered in blood, motionless - it seemed he had kicked the bucket.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "???"</p><p></p><p>What's going on!</p><p></p><p>What kind of logic is this! Where did these people get the courage to fight with these crappy toys!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help hiding himself even more concealed, not even daring to sneak shots, to avoid exposing himself.</p><p></p><p>He thought: "Looking at it this way, my situation is extremely dangerous. If the fortress fires back, I absolutely can't withstand it!"</p><p></p><p>Speak of the devil and he appears.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a hole opened up on the hemisphere fortress, and a black cannon barrel extended out, aiming straight at Su Hao's direction.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Shit!"</p><p></p><p>The rock they were hiding behind didn't seem like it could block the cannon fire.</p>

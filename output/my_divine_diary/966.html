        <h1>Chapter 966</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The two burly men were fighting ferociously, which made Cong Shuleng and Cong Renfei's eyes go wide.</p><p></p><p>A question suddenly popped into their minds: "Is this what a battle looks like? Shouldn't they be using spells, magic weapons, shields, evasion abilities to attack instead?"</p><p></p><p>However, upon closer inspection, they realized this kind of combat was full of violence and bloodshed, yet also possessed a sense of beauty.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful physiques, such a violent yet beautiful aesthetic, and the release from the frenzied strikes - it made the two siblings' blood race.</p><p></p><p>They had never witnessed such a battle before.</p><p></p><p>Following the teachings of Feng Cheng, battles were always fought from a distance, with both sides casting spells elegantly and unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Not just them, but all the supernatural beings in the Infinite Lands fought in an inherited style emphasizing 'technique', making them think this was the essence of battle.</p><p></p><p>At a more basic level, some would engage in close combat with long knives and spears, but even then, there were techniques involved in wielding the blades and spears.</p><p></p><p>The dancing blades and spears were pleasing to the eye, with graceful movements.</p><p></p><p>However, the hand-to-hand combat they were witnessing was nothing like that.</p><p></p><p>It was truly fists pounding into flesh.</p><p></p><p>I'm madly outputting onto your body, like hammering iron, my powerful fists ravaging your frame. One punch to the chest leaves an imprint on the back.</p><p></p><p>But apart from a trickle of blood from the corner of the mouth, it's no big deal. They jump back up, good as new, as if the previous devastating attacks had merely scraped off a thin layer of skin.</p><p></p><p>Seconds later, you're back at full health, fully recovered, then leaping up to pound my iron-like flesh hundreds of times with your fists.</p><p></p><p>It's a contest of who has greater strength, whose blood is thicker.</p><p></p><p>Yet it was this very fighting style that left Cong Shuleng and her brother deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuleng said: "Men like that..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei asked in amazement: "You like them?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuleng pouted: "I'm not like you, I prefer fair and handsome looks. I like men with quality."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei laughed: "Why don't I just help you capture a few of them, then you can pick whichever one you like."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuleng said: "Don't meddle in your sister's affairs, worry about yourself first. Come, let's teleport over for a closer look. The scenes we saw on the Galactic Network can't give us a true sense of their power. This kind of power seems different from what we currently possess - their physical explosive power and resistance to strikes have been tremendously amplified. If it were our celestial bodies without shielding, we'd probably be knocked out by a single one of their blows."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei nodded in agreement: "Their bodies slamming into the ground are like high explosive bombs going off. Their physiques and strength are indeed formidable. If transported to the Infinite Lands, ordinary spells likely couldn't hurt them. Unless they encountered the rulers of those races, they could probably run rampant in the Infinite Lands unchallenged."</p><p></p><p>The two exited the Galactic Network, gathered together, and entered the teleportation chamber, initiating the teleportation program. Soon, they were transported to a corner of this blue-green planet.</p><p></p><p>They cast spells to conceal their forms and flashed towards the battlefield's perimeter to observe the two men's battle up close.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving, Cong Shuleng and Cong Renfei immediately felt an immense oppressive force emanating from the battlefield, as if two invincible primordial beasts were nearby.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying it were intense gusts of wind, one after another.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuleng and Cong Renfei's hearts skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei messaged: "Sister, the aura is so strong. Without a shield, my small frame can't withstand their blows."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuleng laughed: "Even with a shield, one of their punches might still shatter it. The explosive power of those fists - you can only appreciate how strong they are by observing up close. Want to go try it out?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei shook his head as he watched the savage attacks on the battlefield: "One look and I can tell they're not to be provoked. If I act, I won't hold back and won't give them a chance to attack me."</p><p></p><p>Though he said that, the two siblings didn't feel tense at all, given their formidable abilities - it was no joking matter.</p><p></p><p>Even if their opponents attacked, they might not be able to land a blow.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, their teacher had taught them many bizarre "Source Spells" that even the strongest would find difficult to defend against.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei smiled: "Sister, these few men don't seem too bad. Want me to help capture them for you to keep as pets?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuleng ignored him and just said: "Let's wait and see after their battle ends before deciding. It looks like a young martial artist is challenging an old master - can't tell yet who will win or lose. It'd be great if we could understand what they're saying."</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were about to continue watching, two powerful figures suddenly appeared beside them - the two observing martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man frowned as he looked at the empty space in front of him: "Invisible? Hey, you two better leave this place immediately, it's too dangerous for you here."</p><p></p><p>From his senses, these two people were so weak, he could easily crush them with one hand.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't understand why such feeble mortals would wander into this dangerous battlefield.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, even a slight battle aftershock hitting them could prove fatal.</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man candidly told the spiky-haired man beside him: "Tai Cheng, take these two away from here immediately to avoid accidental injury. A battle of this level is beyond our ability to protect them."</p><p></p><p>The spiky-haired Tai Cheng nodded: "Got it, Gao Qi."</p><p></p><p>He then flashed behind Cong Shuleng and Cong Renfei, reaching out to grab their collars.</p><p></p><p>But he grabbed nothing but air.</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng: "???"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuleng and Cong Renfei: "Hey, we haven't even spoken yet..."</p><p></p><p>The two siblings immediately stepped sideways, and Cong Renfei said: "Wait, let's talk first before acting."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuleng whispered: "They probably can't understand us."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "I know, I'm just expressing our intentions for now."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuleng: "Do you have any points left? Redeem a couple language soul imprint packages to share with them."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "Okay...but those aren't cheap, 200 points each..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuleng: "Just do it."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng frowned and tried grabbing again, but his hands passed through their bodies without touching anything.</p><p></p><p>Astonished, he told the short-haired Gao Qi: "Gao Qi, these two are like illusions."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi also saw Tai Cheng's display and immediately flashed back, muttering: "Tai Cheng, fall back."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng retreated at high speed to stand beside Gao Qi, staring at Cong Shuleng and Cong Renfei in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The short-haired Gao Qi said softly: "Their aura disappeared. Strange. When invisible we could sense their aura, but now that they've revealed themselves it's gone. What bizarre martial art is this? More importantly, are they friend or foe?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, two faint yellow mists appeared in Cong Renfei's hands. Glancing at the muscular men in the distance, he turned to Cong Shuleng: "Sister, should I toss these over? They might think I'm attacking with energy blasts."</p><p></p><p>He gestured towards the humanoid monsters exchanging energy blasts in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuleng: "Quite possible."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "Then what should we do? Shall we bind them first before imparting the language imprint packages?"</p><p></p><p>The short-haired Gao Qi and spiky-haired Tai Cheng watched Cong Renfei warily, taking offensive stances, thinking: "Are they going to fight?"</p>

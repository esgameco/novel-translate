        <h1>Chapter 630</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>This was just some of Su Hao's speculation about spiritual power reincarnation, but he did not dare confirm whether it was true or not.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps one day he would suddenly reincarnate into a world specialized in spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao came into contact with more and more things, he increasingly felt the importance of powerful spiritual power to him.</p><p></p><p>Powerful spiritual power could enhance perceptive abilities, which was just one of its functions.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, spiritual power could serve as an extremely powerful 'research tool' for him, allowing him to unravel the laws of things around him to the greatest extent possible.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he was limited by insufficient spiritual power, unable to sense the energy flow of his own 'calamity system'.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had guessed the reason why he would face disasters periodically, he was still helpless about it.</p><p></p><p>This was the limitation of lacking powerful enough spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>This was just one example - it could be imagined that in the future when facing extremely precious knowledge, Su Hao would similarly be limited by his spiritual power, not knowing how to unravel the secrets of that precious knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that be like going to a mountain of treasures but leaving empty-handed?</p><p></p><p>If that were truly the case, how could he ever fully comprehend the knowledge of the universe?</p><p></p><p>Of course, these were just hypotheticals for now, with no definitive conclusions yet.</p><p></p><p>The saying remained: "Everything is possible!"</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Su Hao believed that as his spiritual power gradually strengthened and his consciousness information became more massive, one day he would eventually break through the limits of a 'mortal' and attain 'extraordinary' spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Starting from reincarnating at two or three years old, then later five or six, then eight, twelve - this was the best proof.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power was growing stronger!</p><p></p><p>His mortal nature was accumulating 'quantity', and in the future he may achieve a 'qualitative' transformation!</p><p></p><p>Ten years later. Su Hao had been in this world for over forty years.</p><p></p><p>It was also on this day ten years later that Su Hao successfully used the 'source' to transform compatible 'blood energy' and 'spiritual energy'.</p><p></p><p>From when he began researching transforming the source into matter to now, a total of twenty-four years had passed - it was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, in the end he succeeded in obtaining blood energy and spiritual energy, and the nearly non-stop research over those twenty-four years was worth it.</p><p></p><p>However, the final result of using the source to transform blood energy and spiritual energy was different from what Su Hao had initially imagined.</p><p></p><p>At first, Su Hao had aimed to directly and crudely transform the source into blood energy and spiritual energy, but as his research deepened, he found that with his current abilities it was simply impossible - the interactions between different types of matter were extremely complex, and he could not analyze out the corresponding laws.</p><p></p><p>It was like the motion of outer electrons - you know they move within a certain range, but you don't know exactly where they will go next.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Su Hao changed his strategy: using compound combinations to form mixtures.</p><p></p><p>That is, directly breaking down the deeper microscopic structures of blood energy and spiritual energy, analyzing the combination methods of different compounds.</p><p></p><p>Then, use the source to successively transform these compounds, and combine them one by one into blood energy and spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>It was like different factories producing different components, and finally assembling them according to a certain structure to form a brand new car.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty decreased by a large step.</p><p></p><p>However, merely synthesizing blood energy and spiritual energy was not Su Hao's goal - his goal was to obtain spiritual energy that was compatible with him in one go!</p><p></p><p>For this, he also had a corresponding method, which was to divide space and form a specific structure, with each small space able to transform one compound.</p><p></p><p>For example: if blood energy had nearly a hundred different compounds combined in a specific structure, then he would build nearly a hundred small spaces to separately transform those compounds, and then reassemble and combine them in a certain order to obtain the blood energy!</p><p></p><p>To achieve this, Su Hao spent nearly ten years.</p><p></p><p>After succeeding, he also designed a set of 'production-assembly' spatial workshops for blood energy and spiritual energy respectively, called 'hybrid transformers'.</p><p></p><p>Going through one set of processes could obtain the specific blood energy and spiritual energy, very convenient.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In Lab No. 1, Su Hao extended his left and right hands, eyes half-closed, beginning to construct the 'hybrid transformer'. Five seconds later, construction was successful, and he immediately channeled the source, transforming and slowly inputting more and more into the 'hybrid transformer'.</p><p></p><p>A colorful small ball the size of a fist appeared in each of his palms.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the balls began changing color, one turning red and one turning golden, emitting a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>The whole process took about ten seconds.</p><p></p><p>After the small light balls in Su Hao's hands stabilized, he canceled the spatial barrier, then absorbed the blood energy and spiritual energy from his palms into his body.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao closed his eyes to sense it for a moment, then opened his eyes with a smile, "Success! I've obtained blood energy and spiritual energy compatible with me, though I'm still quite clumsy in operating them and need some time to adapt. Overall, no major issues!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao raised his hand to condense a runic symbol, guiding the blood energy he had absorbed into his body to infuse into the rune. The next moment, a brilliant flash erupted.</p><p></p><p>Then infusing spiritual energy into the rune amplified its power by several orders of magnitude.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao summarized, "The blood energy and spiritual energy transformed from the source perform no differently than what I transform myself! I just need a few days to fully adapt to this newfound energy."</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as Su Hao was given an initiating force, he could obtain an inexhaustible supply of spiritual energy and blood energy.</p><p></p><p>The initial mission had been accomplished!</p><p></p><p>Outside the base, various plants rose and fell, all spirit flowers and spirit grasses tended by Wind Cheng, colorfully dazzling. A few towering dense trees stood silently, with a few pavilions nearby, three or two small ponds with crystal clear water where fish seemed to float in mid-air. A few rays of sunlight shone in from the small world outside, making the entire base feel warmly radiant...</p><p></p><p>Everything visible before his eyes could be utilized by Su Hao!</p><p></p><p>Consciousness was the root, and the body along with the surging, vast blood energy and spiritual energy within were the 'hands' for the consciousness to change the world!</p><p></p><p>At this point, what was most important at the core for him went without saying.</p><p></p><p>That was: consciousness and the knowledge it carried, as well as the body that carried the consciousness!</p><p></p><p>"I can't enhance my consciousness power for now, but I can prioritize accumulating knowledge!</p><p></p><p>I finally have a bit of ability to control my own destiny!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't believe he would die young in this life.</p><p></p><p>In the worst case, even if this planet was destroyed, so what?</p><p></p><p>He could simply board the constructed spacecraft and enter space!</p><p></p><p>Such power!</p><p></p><p>What could the Calamity System do to him?</p><p></p><p>The success of his research inevitably made Su Hao feel a bit smug.</p><p></p><p>The constant 'dying dying dying' had nearly driven him crazy, this was the first time he had touched the smooth skin of 'freedom' so closely...</p><p></p><p>So smooth, to the point that Su Hao felt overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of joy and pride intertwined, wasn't it the same as the emotion from his distant past student days when he finally won over the publicly acknowledged goddess?</p><p></p><p>That 'I'm the most awesome', 'I'm invincible in the world' youthful feeling!</p><p></p><p>With a relaxed, joyful mood, Su Hao strolled around the base, finding everything novel, "Yeah, all of this is my 'source', my energy! Pretty good!"</p><p></p><p>He wondered if he should modify the spacecraft he had designed for Ya Shan, adding more materials, since it would be better to have more matter around when venturing deep into the cosmos later.</p><p></p><p>Rarely sensing Su Hao leisurely coming out for a stroll, Ya Shan and Wind Cheng immediately dropped what they were doing and gathered around him.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng even casually handed Su Hao his favorite fruit juice, smiling, "It's rare for the great Master Wei to be so happy, you must have gained something!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "The basic goal has been achieved - I've successfully transformed usable blood energy and spiritual energy from the source!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Wind Cheng exclaimed in unison upon hearing this, "Master Wei is awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan rolled up his sleeves, "Master Wei, shall we hold a banquet tonight to celebrate? It's been so long since we've indulged in feasting and drinking!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waved his hand grandly, "Let's do it! Throw a banquet!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fei Yao slowly flew over using his flight technique.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Fei Yao's arrival is perfectly timed!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng suddenly proposed, "Recently they released a new 'source-powered sports car' with decent performance. Why don't we each get one after the banquet and have a race?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's eyes lit up, "Driving cars? I love driving! Let's do that!"</p>

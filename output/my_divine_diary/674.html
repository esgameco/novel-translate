        <h1>Chapter 674</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Through the radar display on his fighter jet, Su Hao quickly confirmed the attack target and also saw the group of human fighter jets launching the offensive.</p><p></p><p>He tried operating the controls, and soon was able to smoothly pilot the fighter jet forward.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the group of human fighters encountered the octopus clan's octopus fighter jets up ahead.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all kinds of energy blasts were raining down like raindrops, bombarding each other.</p><p></p><p>The energy blasts looked extremely dense, but in the vast expanse of space, they seemed insignificant. With this exchange of fire, it was just a matter of who was unlucky enough to get hit by the energy blasts.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, the probability was a metaphysical question - whoever got hit would definitely be very puzzled as to why, out of so many people, they were the unlucky one.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, some had already become unlucky right at the start of the clash.</p><p></p><p>There were unlucky ones among the humans and the octopus clan.</p><p></p><p>No matter how skillfully the fighter jets were maneuvered, no matter what fancy moves were pulled, when bad luck struck, there was no avoiding it.</p><p></p><p>However, a fighter jet exploding did not mean the pilot immediately perished.</p><p></p><p>Before boarding the fighter jets, everyone wore thick armor suits. As long as the armor wasn't breached, they wouldn't die immediately, and could even use the propulsion system on the armor to fly back to the ship.</p><p></p><p>But in most cases, they could only wait quietly until the fighter jet battle concluded and the winning side gained the right to kill the defeated opponents.</p><p></p><p>So after a fighter jet was blown up, the pilot could only pray that their teammates would give it their all.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan locked onto his opponent, skillfully maneuvering his fighter through the hail of bullets while launching attacks towards the distant octopus fighter.</p><p></p><p>Energy blasts rained down on the enemy like they cost nothing, but the opponent nimbly dodged them all.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan shouted hoarsely, "Chang, stick close!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he pulled back on the control stick, and the Swallow-type fighter jet reared up, changing direction.</p><p></p><p>He planned to attack from above the octopus monster, as based on his understanding, attacks from this angle were most effective against the octopus clan.</p><p></p><p>The two sides drew closer, transitioning from the initial long-range exchange of fire to selecting individual opponents and entering close-quarters combat.</p><p></p><p>It was at this stage that true skill was exhibited, but it was also the most dangerous - one careless mistake, and their fighter could turn into a tiny firework in the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan could feel his heart pounding wildly in his chest. His field of vision was filled with the flames of exploding fighter jets, but not a single sound reached him - just eerie silence.</p><p></p><p>His face was contorted, but his eyes were exceptionally calm, locked onto the enemy fighter off to the side - an agile, writhing octopus fighter.</p><p></p><p>From their brief earlier contact, he realized this opponent was not only formidable, but extremely tricky. One slipup, and he could be the one blown up.</p><p></p><p>The octopus fighters' close-combat abilities surpassed their own Swallow fighters.</p><p></p><p>They excelled at closing in on opponents, then using all eight tentacles to directly entangle them. The sharp tips of the tentacles could instantly shred both the fighter and the pilot within.</p><p></p><p>In other words, once ensnared at close range by an octopus fighter, it meant certain death!</p><p></p><p>"Can't let it entangle me, need to increase distance first!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan immediately pulled back on the stick, flying away from the opponent while swiveling the cannons to suppress its movement with a barrage of firepower.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the enemy nimbly evaded it all.</p><p></p><p>His mind raced as he sought a strategy, quickly making a decision: "I'll be the decoy, then let Chang finish it off!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Captain Yan shouted, "Chang!"</p><p></p><p>"Captain!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan rapidly explained his plan, then asked, "You got that?"</p><p></p><p>Chang knew he couldn't hesitate - hesitation on the battlefield meant death. His eyes turned bloodred. "Understood, Captain!"</p><p></p><p>He kept telling himself, "You're using the most expensive enhancers. You're the strongest. You can definitely complete the mission."</p><p></p><p>As he repeated this, his focus became more intense than ever before, his mind flashing with the composed, rhythmic movements of Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he entered an extreme state of concentration akin to Su Hao's meditation.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan turned his fighter towards the octopus fighter, firing a continuous barrage of energy blasts that the enemy agilely evaded while counterattacking.</p><p></p><p>Numerous energy blasts came at Captain Yan, but he didn't even furrow his brow, rhythmically weaving the control stick left and right as his fighter bobbed and weaved, dodging all the attacks.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Captain Yan take the initiative to close in, the octopus fighter seemed to be luring him into a trap as it also advanced.</p><p></p><p>Closer and closer, yet neither side could hit their extremely agile foe with energy blasts.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan shouted frantically, "Chang! Get ready!"</p><p></p><p>He then pressed a special button.</p><p></p><p>"Shhhh!" A slight tremor came from the fighter, allowing Captain Yan to seemingly hear a sound.</p><p></p><p>A volley of missiles erupted from the wings, streaking towards the octopus fighter and detonating as they neared.</p><p></p><p>The intense flash of the explosion momentarily blinded the enemy.</p><p></p><p>These were flash bombs!</p><p></p><p>Chang's fighter abruptly emerged from another angle, all cannons swiveling to target the octopus fighter's position, forming a cross with Captain Yan's fighter at roughly a 70 degree angle.</p><p></p><p>Then both fighters opened fire simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Countless energy blasts rained down again.</p><p></p><p>This time, the octopus fighter had nowhere to dodge, taking Chang's barrage head-on.</p><p></p><p>Soon, with its propulsion system damaged and mobility severely reduced, the octopus fighter was closed in on by Captain Yan and blasted into a massive fireball!</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan exhaled deeply, cursing loudly, "Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The octopus monster was instantly killed, bitterly raging in its last moments, "I was the most skilled, but ran into these old coins. Humans really are devious! Let my clansmen take this as a lesson!"</p><p></p><p>This victory did not come easily. Chang and the Captain congratulated and praised each other.</p><p></p><p>"Captain is awesome!"</p><p></p><p>"Chang is awesome!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan and Chang secured a local victory, but from the overall battlefield, the human side was at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>And in such combat, being at a disadvantage meant that disadvantage would gradually grow, impossible for individuals to reverse.</p><p></p><p>Then Captain Yan and Chang slowly realized that the enemies were becoming more numerous while their own comrades were dwindling.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, what do we do?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan said, "Chang, no matter what happens, you must stay calm! Only by staying calm can you survive!"</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>On the Yuanxing command bridge:</p><p></p><p>"Reporting, our fighter group is showing signs of being overwhelmed. Casualties are gradually increasing - fifteen fighters have already been destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"Reporting, the gap between our sides is widening. As of now, we have lost twenty fighters while the enemy has lost thirteen."</p><p></p><p>The captain silently listened to the reports, saying nothing as he stared at the Yuanxing's flight path and the planet 'Tuhui-3758'.</p><p></p><p>To him, being at a disadvantage or on the verge of defeat was an expected situation. His goal had always been to seize an opportunity to head towards 'Tuhui-3758'.</p><p></p><p>'With the fighter group's failure, the ship has also stealthily changed course. We'll pretend to flee in panic - the enemy commander will never guess my intentions...'</p><p></p><p>For victory, sacrifices were unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>And it was at this moment that a lone Swallow fighter jet joined the battle.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had just piloted his fighter into the chaotic battlefield when an octopus fighter immediately came at him, firing energy blasts.</p><p></p><p>He weaved left and right, evading the attack, then tried to lock onto the enemy and fire the mounted energy cannons.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a barrage of energy blasts streamed out, but the enemy dodged them all.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was surprised. "Huh? It's quite agile! Even dodged all that! Seems the distance is too far, giving it enough reaction time."</p><p></p><p>He then piloted the fighter closer, intending to get nearer before attacking again. Unexpectedly, the enemy took the initiative to close in as well.</p><p></p><p>This suited Su Hao just fine.</p><p></p><p>The two closed in on each other!</p><p></p><p>With Su Hao's incredible perception, he had already predicted the enemy's firing trajectory before it attacked, dodging preemptively to perfectly evade the octopus fighter's attack.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, his blasts accurately pelted the octopus fighter, causing it to belch flames.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him was that the octopus fighter was only damaged in parts, not completely disabled.</p><p></p><p>"Must be that gold-inlaid armor - energy blasts can't penetrate it! Hmm...let me try the spatial transference technique!"</p><p></p><p>His sensory range now extended over 2,000 meters, meaning the 2,000 meter radius was his home court. The enemy fighter happened to be within this 2,000 meter range.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao predicted the octopus fighter's trajectory, deployed a spatial module, and activated the energy cannons the instant the enemy entered the module's range.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the octopus fighter exploded into a fireball.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded in satisfaction. "Quite effective, and the blood energy consumption is acceptable. Let me find some other fighters to practice on before going to destroy the enemy ship."</p><p></p><p>He then piloted his fighter into the battlefield, charging any octopus fighters he saw. Once close, he would open fire and blast them apart. Wherever he went, none could stop him!</p><p></p><p>The first to notice this phenomenon were the human pilots.</p><p></p><p>They only saw an ordinary-looking fighter jet suddenly appear from the side, its mounted guns flashing a brilliant light as the octopus fighter they had been grappling with inexplicably exploded.</p><p></p><p>The human pilots: ????</p>

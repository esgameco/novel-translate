        <h1>Chapter 724</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng opened his eyes in the 'life capsule' of the second-level space, muttering, "The Octopus Clan really has some skills! What kind of weapon was that, with such tremendous power!"</p><p></p><p>Then he closed his eyes again, reactivating the 'control avatar' through the assistant, randomly selecting an [Octopus God]. Soon, he completed the match and controlled the [Octopus God] out of the warehouse.</p><p></p><p>While stretching to adapt, he messaged the group, "Chief Wei, Chief Yashan, I died again..."</p><p></p><p>Attaching an awkward emoji.</p><p></p><p>Yashan exclaimed in surprise, "You can even die from this? What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng uploaded the final video, "It seemed to be an energy cannon fired from outer space, just with a rather large caliber. I carelessly didn't dodge..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan marveled, "Could this be the fabled planet-destroyer cannon? Judging from its power, it really packs a punch, causing destruction comparable to a small asteroid impact.</p><p></p><p>When you have time, get one to study how the Octopus Clan achieved this, supposedly humans don't have this technology yet.</p><p></p><p>But you little rascal Wind Cheng are too weak, I gave you top-level equipment for this trip, yet you still died, embarrassing to the core."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng awkwardly replied, "Mainly the tentacle monsters' spatial disruptors were too strong, limiting my normal performance...if I luckily found their spatial disruptors, the result might have been different."</p><p></p><p>Yashan replied with a dog emoji.</p><p></p><p>Not wanting to lose face, Wind Cheng said, "I've already left a positioning stone on that planet. Once I adapt, I'll go back and reclaim the field. It won't be so easy for them to kill me this time."</p><p></p><p>Yashan remarked, "You're just going to get killed again!"</p><p></p><p>Then Xu Hao said, "The [Octopus Gods] are being consumed faster than I expected. Next time you go out Wind Cheng, remember to collect more octopus monsters to make enough spare [Octopus Gods]. And only strong octopus monsters, the scrawny ones don't survive well, just a waste of time.</p><p></p><p>Oh, about the Octopus Clan's spatial disruptor issue, I have a method of using psychic tentacles to sense the source of spatial disruption. I just uploaded it to the assistant, you all find time to learn it to avoid being restricted in future operations."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng marveled, "Chief Wei, you really are all-powerful! I should have asked you how to deal with it when I was on that colony planet earlier!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yashan smirked, thinking, "Wind Cheng is still too green. If it was me facing an unsolvable problem, I would have asked Chief Wei for help long ago! Why wait until dying to react?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao continued, "Wind Cheng, go back again and see if you can capture the mother ship that attacked you. I want to study the operating mechanism of the Octopus Clan's 'planet-destroyer cannon'."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng's [Octopus God] face instantly turned blood red with excitement, angrily saying, "Rest assured Chief Wei, I will definitely bring that mother ship back to you."</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fists fiercely, "This time, I absolutely won't be killed by the Octopus Clan!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "You said the same last time."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng: "......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, Wind Cheng found he could sense the positioning stone he left on the Octopus Clan's colony planet again.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "It seems the octopus monsters have turned off the spatial disruptor. Now I can go get them!"</p><p></p><p>"And record the whole process, then edit the highlights into a short video clip to share in the group, show Chief Wei and Chief Yashan and redeem myself."</p><p></p><p>He notified the group, then concealed his presence and teleported over.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he appeared at the location where he left the positioning stone.</p><p></p><p>After getting his bearings, he headed straight for the large city.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to harvest more energy cubes while the Octopus Clan was still caught off guard, as well as collect more experimental materials for Chief Wei.</p><p></p><p>That was his main mission.</p><p></p><p>As for causing a big ruckus to redeem himself, that was just his personal grievance, he could still prioritize tasks properly.</p><p></p><p>Complete the mission first, then take revenge!</p><p></p><p>"First gather more energy cubes, then destroy the disruptor, and finally find a way to get that mother ship! A perfect plan!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After harvesting a huge amount of energy cubes and 'strong' Octopus Clan members, Wind Cheng was discovered by the Octopus Clan again!</p><p></p><p>Warships and Octopus soldiers were urgently deployed.</p><p></p><p>The countermeasures against the Crystal Demon were implemented.</p><p></p><p>And when the Octopus Clan Ball Leader received the news, he completely broke down...</p><p></p><p>"Damnit! Argh! Wasn't the Crystal Demon already killed? Who can tell me where another one came from? Could there really be a Crystal Demon race!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Quickly activate the 'spatial disruptor' to seal him in, then call in the Xinggang mother ship to take him out! Fire at full power to kill him!"  </p><p></p><p>"No! This planet is no longer safe! I was still clinging to a glimmer of hope before not leaving, but after killing this Crystal Demon, we must immediately evacuate."</p><p></p><p>"Back to the home planet 'Houyuan', only 'Houyuan' is truly safe. After returning, I'll just serve my grandfather, not go anywhere else!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Wind Cheng sensed the space was sealed off again, disabling his teleportation and blinks.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes, his vast psychic tentacles extending out to carefully sense.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he opened his eyes with a concentrated smile, "Found it! Just follow this direction and I can find it."</p><p></p><p>He stomped the ground hard, kicking up dust and rocks, his pink figure instantly vanishing from the spot, dashing off at an imperceptible speed.</p><p></p><p>At first the Octopus Clan Ball Leader thought the Crystal Demon just wanted to find another city to destroy, but when he realized this Crystal Demon didn't stop at the cities he passed, he sensed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>He muttered, "Why isn't this Crystal Demon destroying cities anymore? What is he trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>A clever Octopus Clan member answered, "It seems he's heading straight in our direction."</p><p></p><p>The Ball Leader: "???"</p><p></p><p>The other Octopus Clan members also realized this, saying anxiously, "You're right, that Crystal Demon is indeed running straight towards our location."</p><p></p><p>"His speed is insane, he'll reach our city in at most five hours."</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, is it because we killed the Crystal Demon that was his lover last time, so he's coming for revenge now!"  </p><p></p><p>"Or maybe they're brothers, though this Crystal Demon looks a bit different from the last one, but largely similar! We must have offended an entire powerful Crystal Demon race!"</p><p></p><p>"Idiot, didn't I say this is a bioweapon created by humans?"</p><p></p><p>"You think those lowly human creatures could create such an elegant and powerful Crystal Demon?"  </p><p></p><p>The Octopus Chieftain lashed his tentacles, roaring, "Someone tell me, when will the Xinggang mother ship be ready?"</p><p></p><p>"Eight hours!"</p><p></p><p>The Ball Leader ignored the clamor and silently left.</p><p></p><p>The other Octopuses were aghast, "Where is the Ball Leader going?"</p><p></p><p>The Ball Leader said, "Where else? Of course I'm running away, do you want to stay here and wait to die?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A few hours later, Wind Cheng arrived at a massive Octopus city and found the spatial disruptor device in the suburbs!</p><p></p><p>He smiled and dropped a 10,000-ton bomb.</p><p></p><p>After the intense explosion, his familiar spatial abilities returned.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng threw his head back and laughed uproariously, "I, Wind Cheng, am invincible! Come try to hit me again, if you can hit me I lose!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng scanned with his mind and precisely located the energy cube warehouse, teleporting directly inside and absorbing all the cubes into his miniature world.</p><p></p><p>The energy cubes harvested here exceeded his total haul from last time, a huge bounty.</p><p></p><p>As for the smaller caches of cubes, Wind Cheng didn't bother, having secured the big prizes. He flew up and dropped a massive bomb onto the city.</p><p></p><p>With a tremendous blast, the city was reduced to ruins.</p><p></p><p>The outskirts were spared, but Wind Cheng couldn't be bothered, continuing to search for the next city to harvest energy cubes.</p><p></p><p>A few hours later, the attack came from space again.</p><p></p><p>Just like before, it covered an area nearly 20 kilometers across, sealing off any room for him to evade.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng smiled and blinked, instantly leaving the massive energy cannon's attack range.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, an enormously huge pillar of light descended from the sky, connecting to the ground like the mythical pillars holding up the heavens and earth. Its dazzling brilliance could be clearly seen from another continent by the Octopus Clan.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to happen in an instant, yet also over a long period, before the pillar of light suddenly vanished. The ground rapidly expanded, countless brilliant rays bursting forth from below.</p><p></p><p>The soil blocking the light disintegrated inch by inch. In the world, there was only endless radiance, as if someone had planted a sun underground, but no soil could contain it, everything nearby vanishing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Hummmmm"</p><p></p><p>An intense shockwave accompanied the expansion of this sphere of light, spreading outwards, pulverizing anything obstructing it, including the thick layers of underground rock.</p><p></p><p>"Run!" The only thought in Wind Cheng's mind, instinctively activating teleportation.</p><p></p><p>The ground rapidly fractured layer by layer, spreading out, with nothing able to impede this massive explosive force at all.</p><p></p><p>Everything, in the face of this tremendous blast, seemed so fragile.  </p><p></p><p>Soon, an enormously huge pit appeared on the surface, like someone had scooped out a bite from a spherical cake.</p><p></p><p>The intense shockwave swept across, nearly affecting one-tenth of the planet's surface, covering an entire continent!</p><p></p><p>From an ordinary human perspective, the power was apocalyptic-level destructive.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps just a dozen such blasts could completely annihilate the surface ecology of an entire planet.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng blinked again, teleporting back to the starting position via the positioning stone, then flew towards the area struck by the cannon.</p><p></p><p>He soon saw an end-of-the-world scene, patting his chest in lingering fear, "Wow, that power is insane, my avatar almost got scared to death!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng casually tossed a 'Star-Shattering Cube' into the depths, then soared up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"You actually fired two shots at me, you'll get what's coming to you."</p>

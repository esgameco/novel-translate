        <h1>Chapter 887</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After sending the brother and sister travelers away, Su Hao personally summoned all the deities to heaven for a very serious meeting.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow deities, the World Will has been unable to grow successfully for a long time, and cannot even live long. It has fallen into deep self-doubt, to the point that it has now split into two World Wills again. The situation is quite serious.</p><p></p><p>You can refer to the scenes when you argued with your own avatars to understand the specifics. If the World Will still cannot grow, it might even split into seven or eight at once!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the deities couldn't help but look embarrassed.  </p><p></p><p>Think about it, who were these eighteen of them? They were the great and mighty deities who had reigned supreme for countless years, served and praised day and night. Yet now they had fallen to the point where they couldn't even protect a mere child - it was utterly shameful.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, they had nearly a thousand opportunities, were fully prepared, and had so much protective experience, yet still failed to protect a single child.</p><p></p><p>To the point that they now doubted their own abilities.</p><p></p><p>But they dared assure Lord Lei that they had truly tried their best. It's just that the World Will was too capable of dying, playing out tricks that could probably fill an entire Death Encyclopedia.</p><p></p><p>The deities stated that they were at their wits' end.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said again: "Deities, buck up and carefully review the experiences of past failures. Learn from the lessons, and when facing the World Will in the future, learn to make predictions, list out all possibilities, and then nip the potential occurrences in the bud."</p><p></p><p>The problem was, they had always been doing that, but to no effect.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "If these two World Wills fail again, then the rebirth of the World Will shall come to an end. The World Will will enter a long period of self-reflection, and will not be reborn for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Since even the World Will is undergoing profound reflection, you guardian deities cannot be an exception. So you should also reflect!"</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh—"</p><p></p><p>A 50,000 word reflection report. </p><p></p><p>This was even more painful than not letting them play games!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Su Hao said: "If you don't hand it in, then I will deduct all of your credits."</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh—"</p><p></p><p>This was even more painful!</p><p></p><p>The other deities immediately felt motivated, all stating that they would definitely succeed this time.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao left satisfied. A little pressure, or these deities wouldn't know how awesome they were.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the heavenly realm, Su Hao came to the space outside the Crossed Star, staring at this not-so-large planet in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"The research on the Karmic Waves is still without any leads. It seems to come from the various planets of the Aquarius system, yet also seems to come from outside the starry void. With the travelers as the core, the Karmic Waves extend outwards to a certain distance before fading and widening, like dense fog being blown away. The root source cannot be found at all...</p><p></p><p>How can I bring the entire Karma system into view? I can't even see its full appearance, let alone master and break it."</p><p></p><p>"Is it because the observational methods I grasp are too backward, unable to properly observe the entire Karma system?"</p><p></p><p>Soon he shook his head to deny this: "My Nihility Spiritual Eye must be the strongest means to observe the Karmic Waves. It's just that my understanding of Nihility is insufficient, unable to properly unleash the true uses of the Nihility Spiritual Eye, nor observe the full appearance of the Karma system.</p><p></p><p>So perhaps I can re-conduct deeper research into this Nihility material, and excavate more of its functions."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao deeply looked at the Karmic Waves extending from the Crossed Star, flashed and disappeared from the spot, returning to the laboratory.</p><p></p><p>In the lab, Su Hao randomly transformed a mountain of Nihility material with his Source power, then began pondering how to study this material.</p><p></p><p>"Start from the most basic surface phenomena, then gradually deepen, excavating why it can sense the existence of Karmic Waves. There must be a way to obtain more information."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao left, the deities experienced a brief silence before seriously discussing strategies.</p><p></p><p>After more than a hundred years of experience, these eighteen deities, if taken out, were all top-notch bodyguards...</p><p></p><p>From the deities' standpoint, they had already summarized what things they could do, what things they must do, in order to let the World Will live longer.</p><p></p><p>This was experience, precious experience that ordinary bodyguards couldn't buy with money.</p><p></p><p>After discussing back and forth without any good solutions, the Light Bathing Deity - Yi suddenly spoke: "Through the deaths of so many World Wills, I've summarized some relatively reliable experiences, so I have an idea."</p><p></p><p>The other deities highly regarded Yi's abilities. The Great Oddity said: "What idea?"</p><p></p><p>Yi organized his words briefly, saying: "I don't know if you've noticed, but the World Will doesn't encounter fatal situations immediately after appearing. Rather, it happens after a period of build-up, at a certain moment of 'suddenness' - to the point that even us constantly observing deities don't notice it happening.</p><p></p><p>And this is also the World Will's most direct cause of death. In most cases, there are hardly any signs before the danger arrives. We can only link things together in retrospect during the post-analysis to realize the problem."</p><p></p><p>The other deities nodded in agreement. The Night Deity - Eternal said indifferently: "You make a good point, but it's not that there are no signs of danger. It's that we've skillfully resolved any dangers that showed signs, which is why Lord Yi's statement is not comprehensive. Of course, I'm not denying Lord Yi's point, just offering some opinions. Please continue."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Deity - Barry privately messaged Eternal: "Lord Eternal, why do you always like to refute Lord Yi whenever he expresses an opinion?"</p><p></p><p>Eternal replied: "I can't stand his air of having all the answers, acting like he's the smartest of us deities."</p><p></p><p>Barry: "I don't know if he's the smartest, but he's certainly very smart."</p><p></p><p>Eternal: "Screw you!"</p><p></p><p>Yi didn't mind Eternal refuting him, merely chuckling: "Lord Eternal is indeed correct. What I wanted to say is another issue - that after one danger is overcome, there is usually an interval before the next one appears, and the interval gets longer and longer.</p><p></p><p>I have detailed statistics - the first crisis usually comes within one to four months. If successfully overcome, the next is around one to three years later. After that, no World Will has been able to safely pass the second danger, but I guess the intervals will be even longer. Relatively, when the next danger arrives, it will be even more ferocious."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Deity - Ancient said: "So what is Lord Yi's idea?"</p><p></p><p>Yi dropped his smile, saying seriously: "My idea is that we can create our own 'crisis' scripts based on this time pattern, to replace the unknown dangers."</p><p></p><p>The deities were stunned at first, but quickly understood Yi's meaning: since there would be a danger every interval anyway, they could artificially construct coincidences and build controllable crises for the World Will to overcome safely.</p><p></p><p>A deity raised doubts: "Can the 'crises' we build ourselves replace the original dangers? If not, wouldn't it be even more dangerous? The World Will might die even faster."</p><p></p><p>Yi said: "In fact, in many previous World Wills, I've conducted experiments, secretly and carefully planning many controllable crisis events to test whether the artificial crisis would overlap with the natural one. After multiple verifications, the results greatly surprised me: the crises I designed did overlap with the natural ones."</p><p></p><p>The deities' eyes went wide staring at Yi: "!!!"</p><p></p><p>Yi nonchalantly said: "Of course, I only obtained theoretical correctness, without any successful concrete experiments yet, as you lords know - all the previous World Wills died. I originally planned to share this idea after successful experiments, but didn't expect these two World Wills to already be the last of the first stage, so I have to prematurely present this immature idea."</p><p></p><p>The deities felt like they were struck by lightning. Their first thought was: "No wonder no matter how hard we tried, we couldn't ensure the World Will's survival - there was a traitor among us. The traitor knew all our plans, could interfere with all our operations..."</p><p></p><p>The second thought was: "This bastard, so most of the World Wills were actually killed by Yi playing around. All our efforts over a hundred years were useless. We were taken advantage of by Yi, how vexing!"</p><p></p><p>The third thought was: "If Lord Lei finds out the truth...never mind, this guy Yi deserves a beating. Screw it, beat him up!"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they couldn't beat him up.</p><p></p><p>So: "Verbally destroy him!"</p><p></p><p>And then Yi was drowned in the deities' spittle.</p><p></p><p>As for Yi's idea of 'creating crisis scripts'...</p><p></p><p>The deities couldn't care less. Without venting their feelings first, they stated they couldn't think about the issue normally.</p>

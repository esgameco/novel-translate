        <h1>Chapter 900</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Before the battle between the brother and sister duo and the Crimson Supreme Demon King began, both sides thought the other was just an easy target that could be easily defeated, and that it would certainly be like their previous battles where they could easily achieve victory.</p><p></p><p>However, after the fighting started, they realized this was not the case. As the battle progressed, they gained a new understanding of how formidable their opponent was. If they were not careful, they could very well be defeated.</p><p></p><p>The siblings employed all kinds of tricks, leaving the Crimson Supreme Demon King dazzled and caught off guard several times, dazed and disoriented, allowing the two to escape from danger unscathed. For example, the distracting doll puppet, the disorienting smoke, the blinding fireworks, the illusory fake bodies...</p><p></p><p>However, the Crimson Supreme Demon King's raw power exceeded the siblings' imagination. His dragon-scale armor provided extremely powerful defense that was difficult to penetrate. His attacks were immensely powerful, carrying the might to split mountains and rivers. If carelessly struck, they would be winded for a long time. Most crucially, he was extremely fast - his hundred-meter body moved like a mirage when in motion.</p><p></p><p>The two sides fought back and forth intensely. The entire Demon King Island was left with shattered rocks, flooded by seawater, its castle collapsed. The sounds of battle traveled far, even overpowering the roars of the nearby sea.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like they were evenly matched, but in reality the siblings were at a disadvantage. One careless mistake and they would be defeated, while the Crimson Supreme Demon King looked unusually battered but any blunder was inconsequential - the cost of his trial-and-error was extremely low.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King looked at his castle, now reduced to ruins behind him, and was unusually enraged. How could he have imagined that these two puny humans could possess such tremendous power, to the point of reducing the entire island to ruins?</p><p></p><p>Although this apocalyptic scene on the island was largely his own doing, the fact that they could do this much was enough to demonstrate the formidability of these "Heroic Duo."</p><p></p><p>At the start, he had simply come out to play around.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King thought to himself: "It's a good thing I transferred those dragon younglings away beforehand, allowing me to use my full power without restraint."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the two tiny human figures in the distance and suddenly broke into a crazed laughter: "Humans, you have succeeded in angering the Crimson Supreme Demon King. Tremble before my power!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he suddenly spread his wings and soared into the sky. Dark clouds swirled, fierce winds raged, and flashes of light occasionally flickered in the sky accompanied by rumbling thunder.</p><p></p><p>It was the suppressed yet ferocious lightning.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the lightning seemed like a newborn life force, struggling to stretch its body amidst the dark clouds, trying to break through and come into this world.</p><p></p><p>The battered brother and sister stared blankly at the sky, muttering silently: "What is that..."</p><p></p><p>Even the observing deities were stunned, all looking towards the God of Myriad Thunders - Gu: "Lord Gu, isn't that your ultimate technique 'Realm of Myriad Thunders'? How did this golden dragon learn it?"</p><p></p><p>Gu mumbled: "The range is smaller than my Realm of Myriad Thunders, but it's far more ferocious and suppressed, much stronger. It's not the same ability."</p><p></p><p>As the deities marveled, the thunderclouds began to change.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble—"</p><p></p><p>A bolt of lightning flashed rapidly, extending down from the thunderclouds and connecting to the ground, illuminating the entire sky.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei looked at the crater next to him, his face full of lingering fear. If he had not instinctively moved close to the ground just now, he would have been struck directly. If hit by this seemingly formidable lightning bolt...</p><p></p><p>"Ka-boom—"</p><p></p><p>Another bolt of lightning descended from the sky, striking Cong Renfei's head.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei instantly froze, falling stiffly to the ground and spitting out a puff of thick smoke.</p><p></p><p>"Little Fei!" Cong Shuling cried out in alarm, but she had her own troubles, barely dodging another lightning bolt striking down from above.</p><p></p><p>Only by constantly moving could they avoid being struck by the lightning.</p><p></p><p>Two seconds later, Cong Renfei rolled up from the ground, took out a triangular lightning rod, stabbed it into the ground, and then ducked inside it, laughing loudly: "I have a lightning rod, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Ka-zap!"</p><p></p><p>An even thicker bolt of lightning struck down, hitting the lightning rod directly. But Cong Renfei, sheltered inside, was completely unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling's eyes also lit up, and she took out a similar lightning rod, shielding herself under it.</p><p></p><p>Even in battle, science must be applied.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King rolled his eyes downward: "......"</p><p></p><p>But he didn't mind. He had never intended to defeat these two with just lightning - the lightning was merely the prelude. The more lethal attack was still brewing in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>This was the most powerful technique from the 'Soul Refining Scripture' given to him by his third younger brother. Called the 'Destruction Cannon', he had learned it through repeated simulations, but had never used it before. Today was a good opportunity to test out this so-called ultimate technique and see just how powerful it really was.</p><p></p><p>As the golden light in the Crimson Supreme Demon King's mouth grew brighter, the two siblings sensed impending danger. Cong Renfei curiously asked, "What is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling decisively said, "I sense extreme danger. Let's retreat! Underground Escape Technique!"</p><p></p><p>With that, she burrowed into the ground and vanished. Cong Renfei didn't hesitate either, following her into the underground and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the Crimson Supreme Demon King's technique was ready. He opened his mouth towards the ground and spewed: "Behold - Destruction Cannon!"</p><p></p><p>A beam of light connected to the island below.</p><p></p><p>"Hmmm—"</p><p></p><p>A strange humming sound rang out, and an inexplicable ripple descended upon the surrounding airspace and ocean.</p><p></p><p>Then, a brilliant sun emerged from the island, gradually expanding until it engulfed the entire island.</p><p></p><p>Night suddenly turned into day, as if time had frozen at this moment, and all fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Sound was no longer the focus, nor was the light. The focus was the beauty and awe unleashed in this instant, fleeting yet eternal.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, when the brilliance finally dissipated and everything returned to calm, the island below had completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King stared blankly downwards, muttering: "Where's my island?"</p><p></p><p>Even he himself could not believe he was capable of this level of power.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Destruction Cannon...one shot, one island gone."</p><p></p><p>This made him involuntarily think of his third younger brother: "The one who bestowed upon me the Demon King's power, just how powerful is he? And why have there been no news of him all these years? Where did he go?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a small young red-golden dragon appeared by the Crimson Supreme Demon King's side, smiling: "Crimson, long time no see. I never expected you to reach such heights, impressive, impressive."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King's pupils constricted as he turned to look at the figure floating beside him - a young red-golden dragon smiling at him, appearing very happy.</p><p></p><p>The tall, sturdy physique, those special patterns on his body, that familiar smile and voice, that familiar aura, and this special enclosed space...</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King...no, in front of him, he could not call himself the Demon King, so Crimson was stunned: "Third brother? Lei'an?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "It's me. It's been a while, you've grown into such a big body. Looks like you're still getting enough nutrition."</p><p></p><p>Crimson was shocked, overjoyed, yet also in disbelief, filled more with confusion. He opened his mouth but didn't know what expression to make, stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The lofty aura cultivated by the Crimson Supreme Demon King over a thousand years instantly crumbled.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw Su Hao again, Crimson immediately realized he would be no match for his younger brother Lei'an. A thousand years of effort to catch up was ultimately futile.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Crimson voiced the confusion in his heart: "Third brother, where have you been all these years?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Just wandering around, been to quite a few places. But you've been staying in your Demon King castle for over a thousand years as the great Demon King. Not easy, haha."</p><p></p><p>Crimson also showed a faint smile: "Mainly practicing the Demon King's power you passed down to me. I haven't slacked off all these years. But I never imagined I could sink an entire small island..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "That's normal. When I developed that technique, I intended to use it to shatter an entire planet. You using it to attack a small island is a bit of an overkill."</p><p></p><p>Crimson was dumbfounded: "What planet?"</p><p></p><p>From a cultural perspective, the Crimson Supreme Demon King was simply illiterate.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't answer, but instead approached Crimson, placed his hand on his head, and released his blood energy to record Crimson's consciousness information into the Bouncing Space.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, Crimson offered no resistance, only curious about what Su Hao was doing.</p><p></p><p>After recording the consciousness information, Su Hao said, "Crimson, you've been the evil Demon King for a thousand years and have reached the standard in my heart. Let me give you a gift that will allow you to reach even greater heights.</p><p></p><p>However, your future progress still depends on your own efforts. Remember my words - power is not everything, knowledge is key."</p><p></p><p>With that, Su Hao casually released a purple-red beam of light from his hand that drilled into Crimson's brow, eventually forming a double-ringed imprint there.</p><p></p><p>*Ding*!</p><p></p><p>Crimson: "What's this thing?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 701</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After returning, every member of the Yuanxing ship became a living hero.</p><p></p><p>From a broad perspective, the heroes belonged to all of humanity, receiving welcome from all humans.</p><p></p><p>But from another angle, the heroes belonged to their own families.</p><p></p><p>So, after the welcoming ceremony ended, the crew members walked out of the military port one by one, heading towards their waiting families.</p><p></p><p>The living crew members reunited passionately with their loved ones, overflowing with happiness.</p><p></p><p>For the deceased crew members, their remains and belongings were returned, their families outwardly proud of the heroes, with excited tears glistening, but inwardly gloomy and grieving.</p><p></p><p>Doing the same thing, surviving or perishing, made a complete difference.</p><p></p><p>However, they should be content.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Yuanxing ship's great achievements and meritorious service, even the deceased crew would have been ignored by all.</p><p></p><p>This was already the best possible outcome for the dead.</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao walked, scanning the crowd, from 'Xu Shiqiang's' memories he knew his parents were still alive on Languang and he had a younger sister, so he expected his family in this world would come to meet him.</p><p></p><p>His eyesight was excellent, but after scanning the crowd, he did not find any familiar faces from his memories.</p><p></p><p>As he wondered about this, a call came from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao turned towards the voice to see a middle-aged woman around 40 years old staring at him from outside the fence, her eyes brimming with tears, so excited she was about to cry.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was stunned: "This is...my sister?"</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder he didn't recognize her immediately, because in his memories his sister was a 17 or 18 year old young girl who hadn't even graduated when he left Languang.</p><p></p><p>Now looking at her, she had become a middle-aged woman, completely different from the chattering, manic girl in his memories.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's sister was named Xu Ruyun. Her appearance was still pretty in line with the previous Xu Shiqiang's.</p><p></p><p>Standing beside her was a tall, burly middle-aged man, perhaps her husband? On the other side was a 15 or 16 year old girl who resembled Xu Ruyun, probably her daughter.</p><p></p><p>These two were looking at Su Hao with excited, curious gazes, clearly the fact that 'superhero Xu Shiqiang is my great uncle' had a strong impact on them.</p><p></p><p>On the other side were two elderly white-haired people - Su Hao looked again and recognized them as his original body's parents.</p><p></p><p>The lively young girl had become a middle-aged woman, the black-haired parents had turned white-haired, all in just twenty years.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao walked over, and his sister and brother-in-law immediately came to greet him.</p><p></p><p>These relatives of Xu Shiqiang were so excited to reunite that in the end they couldn't say a word...</p><p></p><p>The sense of separation after twenty years made the atmosphere fall into an awkward silence.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, other crew members were hugging their families directly.</p><p></p><p>It was Su Hao who smiled lightly and said, "Let's go, no need to be polite!"</p><p></p><p>This reunion belonged to 'Xu Shiqiang' and his family. Su Hao himself didn't feel much.</p><p></p><p>His thought was, since he was occupying Xu Shiqiang's body, he didn't mind giving Xu Shiqiang and his family a good ending.</p><p></p><p>After reuniting with his family today, starting tomorrow, he would do his own thing.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao spoke, the atmosphere became much more relaxed, although his words "no need to be polite" still sounded a bit strange to Xu Ruyun and the others.</p><p></p><p>The group got into a car and slowly drove into this huge human city - Victory City.</p><p></p><p>And the atmosphere gradually became more harmonious.</p><p></p><p>Xu Shiqiang's family was just an ordinary, not wealthy family who couldn't afford expensive enhancement drugs.</p><p></p><p>So in twenty years, Xu Shiqiang's parents and sister had slowly aged.</p><p></p><p>Only Xu Shiqiang, by joining the military, had the qualification to receive enhancement drug injections, not only making his body extraordinarily strong, but greatly extending his lifespan and slowing aging.</p><p></p><p>So although Xu Ruyun and the others had mentally prepared, when they saw Su Hao's overly youthful face, they still felt a sense of space-time dislocation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Ruyun was surprised at how handsome her brother had become!</p><p></p><p>She knew her brother - his looks were just average, his tall stature made him look passable, but he would never be associated with the word "handsome."</p><p></p><p>But after twenty years of absence, her brother had become a man of top-tier appearance and demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Most shockingly, it was still Xu Shiqiang's face - she could recognize it was her brother at a glance.</p><p></p><p>The same face, but giving a completely different feeling?</p><p></p><p>And through Xu Ruyun's words, Su Hao also learned the general situation.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had been waiting for Xu Shiqiang's return. As they waited, she started a new family, had a daughter, and their parents slowly aged.</p><p></p><p>Then suddenly one day, news of him came back - overnight he became a human hero, and their family was given the title and treatment of a hero's family.</p><p></p><p>The Commonwealth rewarded them a large sum of money, arranged a standalone villa in Victory City, and most importantly, they received the qualification for enhancement drug injections.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after age 30, injecting enhancement drugs would have an extremely high mortality rate, so in the end only Xu Ruyun's daughter Yonghau received the enhancement.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, the human leader suddenly visited their home in person...scaring them terribly, as they thought Su Hao had unfortunately sacrificed himself.</p><p></p><p>In general, as long as one made corresponding contributions to humanity, the Commonwealth did not mind promoting them fully and giving matching treatment.</p><p></p><p>From Su Hao's perspective, the structure of this human society, under the pressure of the Eight-Armed Race, was relatively vibrant and in a stage of development.</p><p></p><p>The wealthy did have great privileges, even able to receive enhancement drugs and longer lifespans as a priority, but the path for ordinary people to rise was not closed - as long as they contributed to humanity, whether technological or military achievements, they could obtain whatever they wanted.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this path did not seem fair to many, since most people exhausted all their efforts but still could not make sufficient contributions to humanity.</p><p></p><p>But considering the overall social environment and human predicament, it was impossible to be fair to everyone, and this was already an extremely good approach.</p><p></p><p>The reunion dinner went relatively smoothly. The niece Yonghau seemed to have completely opened up, curiously asking this and that across the table, her eyes full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>The key point was, her great uncle was so handsome, all the fantasies of a young girl seemed to be realized in him.</p><p></p><p>"Great Uncle, did you really kill a lot of Eight-Armed monsters?"</p><p></p><p>"Great Uncle, are the Eight-Armed monsters as brutal, cruel and stupid as in the movies?"</p><p></p><p>"Great Uncle, the Eight-Armed ships are so powerful, how did you defeat them?"  </p><p></p><p>"Great Uncle, on the ship, were you the strategist or the warrior? I heard you could take on a hundred alone, and I also heard with just one of your strategies, you captured five Eight-Armed ships!"</p><p></p><p>"Great Uncle you're amazing!"</p><p></p><p>"Great Uncle, you're my idol, and the idol of all my sisters too! They're so jealous of me! They said they want to meet you!"</p><p></p><p>"Great Uncle, let me tell you a secret, those sisters of mine said that if you don't mind, they're all willing to marry you together. Hee hee hee!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! I've also noticed a lot of boys looking at me weirdly..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Once little Yonghau opened up, her mouth was like a machine gun, chattering non-stop.</p><p></p><p>It seemed in this short hour or two, she wanted to release all the excitement from years of "my great uncle is a superhero."</p><p></p><p>She remembered when she was very young, she was just a sensitive, self-conscious little girl. But she didn't know from when, her life changed - she was no longer someone others looked down on, she was reborn, as if becoming the happiest little princess in the world...</p><p></p><p>All of this was brought to her by her great uncle.</p><p></p><p>The way she looked at her great uncle, besides "admiration" and "reverence," there seemed to be... a human-shaped diamond and gold?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao just smiled lightly: "As long as you're all happy."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had three small worlds - one was the previous "research small world" left in the dorm where all the "Gods" were placed; one was the former cage for the Eight-Armed Race prisoners, now used to raise Star-Devouring Worms; the last was used to store the five captured Eight-Armed warships.</p><p></p><p>That very night, Su Hao found a new location and placed the "research small world" thousands of meters underground in the rock layer beneath Victory City.</p><p></p><p>The "Worm Small World" was moved by Su Hao to a barren rocky planet he had visited before, in case something happened and the worms escaped, at least they wouldn't affect Languang.</p><p></p><p>As for the "Warship Small World," Su Hao did not move it, leaving it on the planet where he had originally attacked the supply station.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Su Hao went alone to the military affairs office, submitted a request for transfer, and according to the staff's instructions, submitted a specific report.</p><p></p><p>Under the admiring gazes of everyone, he walked out of the military affairs office.</p><p></p><p>With his divine sense, he locked onto the captain's position and headed straight for the captain.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the captain was still hugging his young wife asleep. Su Hao didn't care about that.</p><p></p><p>Under Su Hao's control, his voice precisely entered the captain's ear.</p><p></p><p>The captain jerked awake with a start.</p><p></p><p>His wife complained: "Gong Liang, what are you doing, so startled!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 546</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>What's pretending?</p><p></p><p>All the mages waiting in the auditorium hall to see the 'hairy squad' in all its glory watched in silence as the three walked into the hall and handed over their quests.</p><p></p><p>After the association confirmed that the pig's head was indeed the head of that bizarre source beast, they quietly watched the trio leave again.</p><p></p><p>And then the entire auditorium hall 'boomed' with activity.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Hairy Squad? How come it's not like the rumors, there's not much hair!"</p><p></p><p>"That's bullshit! How can it be a hairy squad with three brats whose hairs have only just grown out!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go! Why isn't the one leading the mission the Hairy Squad? Where did this guy come from? It looks like he has a good aura and is very powerful."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that there was a squad that fought with the 'Hairy Squad' for the loot before, could it be them?"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss - it's terrifying to think so! The Multi-Hairy Squad shouldn't be ......"</p><p></p><p>"Can't be! The Multi-Haired Squad is said to be the team with the Source of Guile mage."</p><p></p><p>"I've asked, the squad that turned in the quest is called the 'Yang Wang Xing' squad, it seems like I've heard of it somewhere."</p><p></p><p>"Huh, it sounds like the squad that solved the 'nowhere to run' disaster a year ago!"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>"The Hairy Squad has messed with someone unimaginable!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Xing walked out and laughed, "Cool! It's so damn cool! Much better than looking at the cute girls in town."</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang hemmed and hawed, "But I still think it's better to look at cute girls!"</p><p></p><p>"That means you haven't grown up yet, Ah Wang!"</p><p></p><p>"Che!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah Yeung, you tell me, is it cool to do the quest or look at the girl?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Reading is more enjoyable!"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing Ah Wang: "????"</p><p></p><p>Ah Yeung is not right!</p><p></p><p>Taking a look through the field of vision, he saw that the two of them, Yashan and Feng Cheng, had already transformed into [Destiny Sons], and there were patches of blood everywhere, and the entire base was in disarray as if it had gone through a great battle for the ages.</p><p></p><p>It was too late to ask more questions, Su Hao immediately said to Ah Xing and Ah Wang, "Ah Xing and Ah Wang, I have to leave in an emergency, you guys go back to Huai Shui Town by yourselves, you don't have to wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he dodged into a wall with a flash, transformed into [Destiny Son], and then teleported to Yashan's side.</p><p></p><p>Instantly and laid down the 'Opposite Space Barrier'!</p><p></p><p>Both Yayama and Feng Cheng had their arms and legs amputated and fell to the ground, and the adamantine armor was surging rapidly to repair their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Not understanding what had happened, but now was not the time to ask about this, Su Hao directly said, "Yashan, I'll take Feng Cheng away, so you can teleport away yourself first! Let's talk about other things later."</p><p></p><p>Reaching out to grab Feng Cheng, he wanted to take Feng Cheng and teleport away, however, just as his hand reached out, the hard and unparalleled adamantine armor on his arm immediately appeared to be scarred, and countless adamantine armors burst apart, splattering blood.</p><p></p><p>His hand, was injured!</p><p></p><p>Not only did the 'Opposite Space Barrier' fail, the 'Crunchy Defense' attached to the armor did not work either, this was the second time he had broken his defense since he had gained so many defenses!</p><p></p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p></p><p>The entire arm unexpectedly broke off just like that and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>A light flashed in Su Hao's brain, immediately judging the current form, "Strange disaster! A bizarre disaster has occurred at the base!"</p><p></p><p>Simply!</p><p></p><p>He had long foreseen that something weird would happen, but he didn't expect it to come so suddenly, and the most ballsy thing was that it happened directly at the base.</p><p></p><p>When he first chose the location of the base, he didn't have any special ideas, he just thought that this place was quite hidden and suitable for Yashan and Feng Cheng to stay temporarily, so he chose this place, and he didn't expect that there would still be a bizarre disaster!</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also hurriedly said, "Walking and waving such movements will lead to inexplicable attacks on the corresponding parts, and the adamantine armor can't protect against it, and the more violent the movement, the higher the intensity of the attack."</p><p></p><p>Yayama also added, "After a while, not moving will also suffer attacks."</p><p></p><p>After the base was inexplicably attacked, the first reaction of Yayama and Feng Cheng was to find the enemy who dared to destroy the base, however, when they raised their feet to take a few steps, their feet inexplicably broke off, and when they raised their hands, their hands broke off as well, frightening them to the point that they did not dare to move.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after stopping, their bodies were no longer harmed.</p><p></p><p>That's when Yashan thought about how to take Feng Cheng away. According to Boss Wei, when encountering an unknown situation, teleporting to escape was the right thing to do.</p><p></p><p>When he thought that it would be fine as long as he didn't move, in less than ten seconds, every part of his body suffered an attack, his body fell to pieces, if it wasn't for the strong vitality of the [Fate Son], this wave could have directly taken him away.</p><p></p><p>"Leave first." Su Hao couldn't think of that much for a moment, and stopped trying to reach out, instead, he used a super short range flash, appeared next to Feng Cheng, next to him, and then teleported away with Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Yashan also happened to finish his preparations for teleportation at this time, and disappeared into place.</p><p></p><p>In an instant the entire messy base became empty.</p><p></p><p>After a few more seconds, the ground of the base wall violently cracked, as if it had been cut and pierced by thousands of invisible long swords, and was soon covered with smoke.</p><p></p><p>After a few more moments, it subsided and became silent once again, with only wreckage and pitted walls all over the ground.</p><p></p><p>The assembly line machinery that had just been installed in the base for a short time had already been scattered and completely scrapped.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Pill assembly line that had been manufactured with great difficulty was gone just like that.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's trio floated a few thousand meters in the air, using the far-seeing rune to look down on the base's location.</p><p></p><p>Yashan smacked his lips and said, "This is the bizarre disaster ...... It's really bizarre and indefensible!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng heatedly laughed, "The first time I heard about bizarre disasters, it was quite novel, but when it really fell on my head, I realized how terrifying it was! When my hands and feet were cut off on the ground just now, I was dumbfounded."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "When there is no outbreak of bizarre disasters, there is no way to guess what form it will appear in, it is really undefendable, bad luck how it is gone without knowing.</p><p></p><p>This time, the bizarre disaster's ripple range is only five hundred meters, much smaller than any I've encountered before, but the intensity is very high, and the destructive power within the range is extremely strong!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Boss Wei, what to do now, let it go or solve it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Resolve it! After the weird disaster is gotten rid of, it will leave behind a source artifact, which is just the right time to use it for a little experiment."</p><p></p><p>Excitement appeared on Feng Cheng's face as he said, "Go inside and solve it, or just blow the base flat? If 10,000 explosions are thrown down, the bizarre disaster should be gone!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao lost his smile and said, "If it was that simple, it would be good, it is said that by destroying the 'nucleus' of the entire bizarre disaster, it is highly likely that the bizarre disaster here will be transferred to other locations and regenerate, and of course, there is also a possibility that it will spread out.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the solution to the disaster is still in accordance with the methods of this world, they have experienced the onslaught of bizarre disasters for an unknown number of years, and they are definitely better at dealing with disasters than we are."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Then how should we find the 'lead'? How about Boss Wei letting me try? I think I can!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "I've also seen many people who thought they could solve bizarre disasters, but after entering the bizarre disaster, they never came out again! Of course, they all thought they were the unique one just like you."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said awkwardly, "I really think I'm the unique one!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "There's no point in recklessly rushing into the nine deaths. Moreover, bizarre disasters look dangerous, but as long as you know its triggering mechanism, the danger is actually greatly reduced, so the correct way to solve bizarre disasters is to spy on the intelligence and map out the triggering mechanism."</p><p></p><p>The two were curious, "How to poke around?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at Yashan and revealed an inexplicable smile, "Yashan, don't you remember that I was once a powerful summoner?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan's eyes lit up and said, "Boss Wei are you trying to cultivate a large number of specialized bizarre disaster detection mice?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "That's right! So, Yashan Fengcheng, I'll give you guys a task, go and catch some snakes, rats, rabbits, and other small animals for me right now, so that they can map out the bizarre disaster mechanism for us, and then, we'll go and solve the bizarre disasters."</p>

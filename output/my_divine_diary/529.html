        <h1>Chapter 529</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>根据你提供的中文内容,我将尽力翻译成英文:</p><p></p><p>After the Source Beast was completely killed, Source Pearls would form inside its body. </p><p></p><p>The specific location was uncertain, but they could be found by following the perception without being missed.</p><p></p><p>This time, they harvested as many as fifty-two Source Pearls, twice as many as those obtained from the Molten Disaster.</p><p></p><p>Each person got seventeen pearls, and Su Hao took the remaining one, but as per the old rule, he would have to treat them to a meal after returning.</p><p></p><p>On the way back by the flying vehicle, A Xing kept exclaiming in amazement: "A Yang, your 'Precision Detonation' is simply invincible! Whoever you target dies without hesitation. From now on, you'll be the ace combatant of our Sunlight Star Squad."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao found their astonished looks amusing and calmly said, "That's just a minor trick. If you develop your abilities well, you can do much better than that."</p><p></p><p>A Xing said helplessly, "It's not that easy!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was not a Qi Source Master, so he didn't understand and couldn't provide corresponding guidance. He could only think about it himself.</p><p></p><p>A Wang also asked, "A Yang, can you really sense Source Beasts from 10,000 meters away?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "I should be able to! But I need to try more to know for sure."</p><p></p><p>Then A Wang curiously asked, "If it's closer, can you sense beautiful girls?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao almost kicked A Wang off the flying vehicle.</p><p></p><p>He was really speechless about these two teammates whose minds were full of beautiful girls. But then again, it was normal! Who didn't think like that when they were young?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Su Hao had long passed the uncontrolled stage of admiring beautiful girls. His current pleasure was exploring the unknown mysteries of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it a wonderful thing to witness a corner of the universe's miracles every time?</p><p></p><p>Of course, for him, witnessing was only one part; gaining rewards was the key to keeping him continuously excited.</p><p></p><p>After returning to Huai Shui Town, Su Hao treated the two to a good meal at the usual place.</p><p></p><p>As they were about to disband, A Xing said seriously, "A Wang, A Yang, you need to be mentally prepared. Our next mission is the Ominous Disaster! The specific time is unknown, but once we receive the mission, we'll set off immediately."</p><p></p><p>A Wang nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "I'm getting more and more curious."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This mission came unexpectedly soon.</p><p></p><p>After a brief rest, Su Hao was teleported to the temporary research base the next day to continue his unfinished gene design and cultivation work.</p><p></p><p>One day later, the first stage [Shen Jia Human] gene modification liquid for Ya Shan and Feng Cheng was cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this gene modification liquid not only allowed the two to evolve into [Shen Jia Humans] but also changed their appearances, commonly known as plastic surgery, to ensure that no one would recognize them in the future.</p><p></p><p>One injection each, and after four to five hours, the two woke up.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan had long been indifferent to becoming a [Shen Jia Human] and calmly accepted his transformation. It was Feng Cheng, who had scales all over his body for the first time, who excitedly shouted and cheered. After transforming into a Qilin armor, he punched his own body repeatedly, exclaiming how satisfying it felt.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two successfully evolve without any weakness from expending a large amount of Qi, but rather with high spirits, Su Hao gently rubbed his chin, deep in thought: "Perhaps I could try skipping stages of evolution, like directly evolving from a Level 1 Anomaly to a Level 3 Anomaly, then from Level 3 directly to Level 5, and then to Level 7... This way, it could save a lot of time."</p><p></p><p>Previously, Su Hao had conducted experiments on skipping levels of evolution, but the mortality rate was terrifyingly high, almost a 90% chance of death. The reason, as he concluded, was that the body's energy was insufficient to supply the consumption required, causing the evolution to stop halfway and leading to gene collapse and death.</p><p></p><p>Now, the situation was different. Ya Shan and Feng Cheng had started refining their Qi, accumulating a large amount of energy in their bodies, enough to supply the evolution directly from Level 1 to Level 3.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the success rate should be extremely high.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, if they failed and died, would it matter? No, they could just find two more destined individuals to awaken.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>No longer paying attention to the two foolishly fighting each other, he turned to research the 'Spirit Grass' instead.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Su Hao called Ya Shan over.</p><p></p><p>"Ya Shan, the genes of these six plants have been modified. The rest is up to you."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan thumped his chest, "Leave it to me!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment, then teleported back home. As soon as he appeared, he saw Big Dog staring at him with eyes the size of copper bells. He smiled, "Big Dog, come on, I'll take you to a nice place today."</p><p></p><p>Big Dog immediately jumped and bounced excitedly, "Swoosh," running downstairs. Seeming to have waited for a while without seeing his master come down, he ran back upstairs, poking his dog head out from the staircase, looking at Su Hao. Seeing Su Hao walking over, he excitedly ran back down again.</p><p></p><p>This repeated several times.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao reached the first floor, he found that Big Dog had already opened the door and was wagging his tail outside, looking at Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had been reborn in this world for a year and a half, and this was the first time he took Big Dog out. Clearly, this dog had been cooped up for too long.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that its master was taking it out for a walk, it became so excited that all its fur stood on end.</p><p></p><p>But what it didn't know was that its master was actually taking it to be fostered.</p><p></p><p>This dog had an exceptionally energetic spirit. It ran all the way to the temporary base 10,000 meters outside Huai Shui Town without even panting.</p><p></p><p>After bringing Big Dog into the base, Su Hao said to Ya Shan, "I may have to go out on a long-term mission for a while. You just look after this dog and make sure it doesn't starve. You don't need to take care of anything else."</p><p></p><p>Big Dog froze, wondering if its little master was going to sell it to a dog meat trader.</p><p></p><p>Big Dog whimpered in sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan asked, "Master Wei, when will you go out on a mission? When can Feng Cheng and I go out on missions with you?"</p><p></p><p>He was extremely curious about the outside world and wanted to go out with his Master Wei to resolve all kinds of disasters. However, every time, Master Wei would refuse, saying he hadn't learned the common language of this world yet.</p><p></p><p>About this, Ya Shan could only say, "It's so difficult!"</p><p></p><p>Learning the language was like an invisible cage, confining him within this small base, and he didn't know when he would be free.</p><p></p><p>It was even more difficult for Feng Cheng. That guy was in more pain learning the language than him, forgetting words after memorizing them, then memorizing them again after forgetting, repeating this cycle in agony.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "We'll see when you can communicate fluently in the common language of this world!"</p><p></p><p>As expected, Ya Shan covered his head and sighed. This brain was not easy to use!</p><p></p><p>The only consolation was that Feng Cheng's brain seemed even worse than his.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stayed at the base for two more days, conducting various experiments with the Source Pearls and observing the characteristics of 'Source,' but he didn't make any special discoveries. He only became more skilled in using Source.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Su Hao teleported back home and found a note in the door crack. He opened it and read:</p><p></p><p>"The third mission has been received. Meet at the usual place tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>"The Ominous Disaster, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Ever since being reborn, he had heard rumors about the Ominous Disaster many times but had never truly witnessed its power. He was extremely curious and now finally had the opportunity to experience it. He looked forward to it to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ominous Disaster was said to be very dangerous, who was he? Would he be afraid of such petty danger?</p><p></p><p>To be honest, even if he just stood still and let someone try to cut him with a knife, not many people could actually harm him.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Su Hao arrived at the east gate of the small town and found his two teammates already waiting there.</p><p></p><p>The two stood upright by the gate, leaning against the door frame, each carrying a bulging travel bag. They kept fixing their hair again and again, hoping to show their most handsome side to any girls passing by.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao remarked, "Am I late? Sorry for keeping you waiting!"</p><p></p><p>A Xing shook his head, "No, you're not late. We just didn't sleep well last night, so we got up early today."</p><p></p><p>"A Yang, have you really prepared yourself? Facing the Ominous Disaster, mere passion is not enough. If you're unlucky, no matter how I assure you, you might very well die in there.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps you think you're powerful enough to defeat any enemy, but resolving the Ominous Disaster relies not only on strength but also on insight and luck.</p><p></p><p>In the Ominous Disaster, strength may not be effective at all. Even if you can shatter mountains and seas with a punch or turn rivers upside down with a wave of your hand, under certain mechanisms, it's useless. If it says you die, you die, no reasoning."</p><p></p><p>A Xing paused and continued, "So, A Yang, you can still back out now if you regret it. It's not too late to wait until you've accumulated more experience."</p><p></p><p>He spoke so seriously, firstly to prepare Su Hao for a potential one-way trip, and secondly because they themselves had doubts on the verge of departure.</p><p></p><p>A Xing and A Wang were actually afraid too. They didn't know what they would face this time, nor did they know if they would ever have a chance to return to Huai Shui Town after leaving.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Of course I'm prepared and ready to set off anytime. A Xing, A Wang, don't worry. No matter what, nothing will happen. In a sense, I'm much more formidable than the disaster itself. If it doesn't hide from me, it'll be unlucky."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao's confidence, A Xing laughed heartily, "Good, then let's go! Only those who are confident and fearless can overcome the Ominous Disaster."</p><p></p><p>A Wang sighed quietly beside them, turning to look at Huai Shui Town. He thought to himself, "I hope I can come back and see the girl I love again. As long as I can return alive, I will definitely confess to you! Definitely!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we can talk on the way!"</p><p></p><p>A Xing turned and took the lead out of the small town, taking out a scroll from his backpack and unrolling it. "The Ominous Disaster we're facing this time is called the 'Willow Mountain Ominous Incident'!"</p>

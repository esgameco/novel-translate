        <h1>Chapter 549</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>For a while, Su Hao thought about many things.</p><p></p><p>If blood vigor could truly be transformed into source, what about spiritual power?</p><p></p><p>Based on the speculation from the blood vigor experiment, if the source device could indeed emit a special fluctuation that affects surrounding objects and transforms them into source, then could it be that sand is able to block this fluctuation and be immune to this special fluctuation?</p><p></p><p>From another perspective, if blood vigor can become source, conversely, can source become blood vigor?</p><p></p><p>If they can be interchanged...</p><p></p><p>Would it mean that in the future, by casually breaking off a twig, he could turn the twig into source, and then into blood vigor or spiritual power?</p><p></p><p>All kinds of questions violently bombarded Su Hao's mind, leaving him in a state between wakefulness and daze, as if he had contemplated countless questions, yet also as if he hadn't contemplated anything at all and reached no conclusions.</p><p></p><p>His entire mind was in a mild state of chaos.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, he gradually calmed down and recorded all the questions he had considered on his task board, leaving them to be solved in the future.</p><p></p><p>But the most important thing currently was: conducting experiments.</p><p></p><p>From simple to difficult, collecting a large amount of data bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>"Try it out...whether spiritual power can also activate the source device!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao reined in his excitement and carefully channeled a large amount of spiritual power into the source device. Initially there was no change, but after a while, the source device gave off a faint glow, which was the manifestation of it being activated.</p><p></p><p>After entering the ball space to examine, he found that just like blood vigor, there was the same extremely rare phenomenon of spiritual power dissipating and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Not only blood vigor, but spiritual power could also work!</p><p></p><p>"I roughly understand now why the source device needs to be stored in sand. Storing the source device in other materials might cause it to assimilate those materials into something akin to source, and then activate the source device, forming new bizarre disasters. Sand, on the other hand, is highly stable and inexpensive, not easily assimilated by the source device, yet ubiquitous..."</p><p></p><p>Whether this was truly the case, he only needed to conduct some experiments to confirm.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, Su Hao stored this "processing blade" source device in water, wood, metal, cotton cloth, meat and other materials, and quietly observed the changes occurring on them.</p><p></p><p>The most important aspect of these experiments was to confirm whether these substances had indeed transformed into source under the special radiation of the source device.</p><p></p><p>If that was truly the case, then this source would be very interesting.</p><p></p><p>Materials could become source, and conversely, source could also become other things.</p><p></p><p>For example, "energy-type source masters" could turn source into explosive energy, "material-type source masters" could turn source into some unstable quasi-material, "illusion-type source masters" could turn source into all kinds of bizarre functions...</p><p></p><p>It was like the wondrous bead in the hands of the Creator that could evolve into all things.</p><p></p><p>Yet this priceless bead, on this planet, was ubiquitous and exceptionally cheap.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the people of this world all knew the preciousness of source, but after so many years, people's understanding of source was limited to simple applications, unable to unravel the deepest mysteries of source. This showed how difficult it was to unravel the mysteries of source.</p><p></p><p>However, whoever unraveled the secrets of source first would become the "Creator", perhaps!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's emotions became excited again. If this was true, source would aid him in unimaginable ways.</p><p></p><p>As long as there were materials, they could be transformed into source, and then source could be transformed into anything he wanted, including blood vigor, spiritual power or other things.</p><p></p><p>After dying in this life and being reborn in the distant future, he wouldn't need to painstakingly cultivate spiritual power or slowly take spirit-strengthening pills to practice immortality!</p><p></p><p>This would be his ideal reincarnation state!</p><p></p><p>Moreover!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps...he could even find a way to physical immortality from source?</p><p></p><p>It was all possible!</p><p></p><p>Source showed him too many possibilities. Things that seemed unscientific before all became natural in the face of source.</p><p></p><p>In the future, as long as he had enough source, he could even casually create a life-bearing planet in the cosmic domain...</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was endlessly imagining this wonderful future, Ya Shan sent him a message.</p><p></p><p>"Boss Wei, the custom machinery from Changqing Factory has encountered some obstructions. The old factory director has been transferred out, and Old Ying and Old Hu have also been reassigned. The other people know me, but they don't dare take it upon themselves to help us customize machinery."</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Now we can't find the factory director or Old Ying and the others. Apparently because Changqing Factory's profits were too high, someone got jealous. After the other technicians mastered the key technologies, they took advantage of their connections with the Source Masters Association and directly transferred the leadership away. A new batch of people was parachuted in to take over Changqing Factory for themselves. Now if we ask them to manufacture another production line for us for free, it will be very difficult. And with our current economic conditions, we can't afford the cost either...Boss Wei, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao revealed a cold smile: "What should we do? I'm already eager to break through to the Celestial Transformation Realm, yet at this critical juncture they actually dare to obstruct my cultivation and research. They're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "Take them down?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily: "Call Feng Cheng, we'll take them down together!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Although he spoke boldly, some tricks were still needed for the actual "taking down."</p><p></p><p>If they didn't have any forces to threaten the others, he would just recklessly charge in, beat everyone down, and make them obediently work for him.</p><p></p><p>The key problem was that in this world, there were exceptionally bizarre "illusion-type source masters of the uncanny" and the Source Masters Association even collected all kinds of source devices.</p><p></p><p>If they acted recklessly, who knew what bizarre way they might die.</p><p></p><p>So recklessness was inadvisable.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao brought Feng Cheng and transmitted to Ya Shan's side, then the three of them all transformed into [Commandroids], three tall crystal-armored figures who concealed their forms and floated high in the air, looking down at Changqing Factory below.</p><p></p><p>Changqing Factory had now expanded, with newly constructed plants all around that were roaring nonstop in operation.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan suggested: "Boss Wei, why don't we go to Huchang City first and level the Source Masters Association's headquarters building? No matter what, we can't separate ourselves from their involvement."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, they couldn't completely separate themselves from the Source Masters Association's involvement. After all, in this world, all the lucrative businesses were monopolized by the Source Masters Association - this was common knowledge among the masses. No one could say anything about it, and no one dared to.</p><p></p><p>After Changqing Factory expanded in scale, it would be taken over by people sent by the Source Masters Association. The old factory director, Old Ying and the others had foreseen this long ago. No one felt there was anything improper about it.</p><p></p><p>Except for Ya Shan.</p><p></p><p>He had run back and forth between Changqing Factory and the Source Masters Association for several days, but in the end, besides getting fed up, there was no progress at all. Crucially, the few times he found people from the Source Masters Association, as soon as they saw he wasn't a source master, they didn't even let him finish speaking before kicking him out, nicely calling it: "Ordinary people are prohibited from approaching."</p><p></p><p>This really infuriated him!</p><p></p><p>Originally, for future convenience, he had provided Changqing Factory with quite a few high-level private goods. But now that new people had taken over, they didn't even recognize him, this "Honorary Special-Grade Research Expert."</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the question of whether the Source Masters Association people had brain problems, just look at the technology he had initially invested in Changqing Factory - it had all gone to waste!</p><p></p><p>He was determined that if Boss Wei didn't explicitly object, he would level that headquarters building. As for the efforts from the past half year, he would just consider it feeding a big dog.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't care about Ya Shan's petty grudge-holding. After thinking it over, his eyes slowly lit up as he came up with a brilliant idea: "Whether to level it or not is up to you. I've thought of a good solution that can resolve the problem once and for all, without having to worry about provoking the Source Masters Association people."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan curiously asked, "What solution?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed at the various production plants and factories below: "We'll directly move the entire Changqing Factory away! In the future, if we want to manufacture any machinery, with all these abundant lathes, it will be very simple. As the saying goes, 'Better to rely on oneself than others'!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were momentarily dumbstruck, their eyes rolling wide open.</p><p></p><p>This was possible?</p>

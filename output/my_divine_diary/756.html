        <h1>Chapter 756</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After determining the direction, Su Hao immediately organized his research plan.</p><p></p><p>This plan was simply divided into three steps:</p><p></p><p>First, collect 'massive samples', analyze their interference with space-time, record it, and find patterns;</p><p></p><p>Second, observe the patterns of changes in the spatial modules affected by matter, record them, and find patterns;</p><p></p><p>If he could truly complete these three steps smoothly, then he would have absolute confidence in achieving 'planetary network positioning and teleportation'.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of this was not high, it was just collecting samples and summarizing patterns.</p><p></p><p>But it required extremely high precision with the data and consumed a very long time, testing one's energy.</p><p></p><p>He came to a rocky planet and began collecting rock samples from this planet.</p><p></p><p>"Start by analyzing the ubiquitous rocks, step-by-step!"</p><p></p><p>Normally, 'collecting samples, organizing samples, gathering data' was the most time-consuming work.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this was a high-tech task that could not tolerate the slightest carelessness, so Ya Shan and Feng Cheng could not help much, he could only do it himself.</p><p></p><p>The days of focused research always passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>It was not until ten years later that Su Hao barely completed collecting and organizing the sample data, and found the patterns of how various objects interfered with space-time.</p><p></p><p>But this only completed the first step, he did not relax, and immediately began the second research project.</p><p></p><p>"Next is to analyze how the corresponding spatial modules in the 'space world' change after space-time is disturbed. This is another long-term project!"</p><p></p><p>Without much thought, Su Hao immersed himself again in summarizing the patterns of spatial module changes.</p><p></p><p>Five years flashed by, and he finally successfully summarized the patterns of how 'spatial curvature' affects 'spatial modules'.</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly verifying and confirming there were no errors in the data, Su Hao finally put down the samples that filled a small world.</p><p></p><p>"Next is just to write an automatic recognition program to link these two patterns together."</p><p></p><p>His goal was to be able to observe an object in the 'planetary network', and have the automatic recognition program immediately analyze that object.</p><p></p><p>Then it would call the 'space-time curvature' and 'spatial module' data, calculate through a specific formula, and obtain the corresponding motion pattern of the spatial module.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it could even help mark out the corresponding spatial module in the space world for him...</p><p></p><p>In other words, the so-called 'one-click automatic casting'.</p><p></p><p>After all, for such a complex process, although his mind could calculate it, it would take too long.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao exited from the [Eight-Armed God] and returned to his main body.</p><p></p><p>He pushed open the door of the life capsule and walked out.</p><p></p><p>Walking and stretching his body, making crisp 'crack' sounds from all over.</p><p></p><p>Even as powerful as his main body at the [Fate Seed] and Avatar Realm cultivator level, without activity for a long time, he would feel stiff and sore all over.</p><p></p><p>Writing the automatic recognition program was not urgent, he might as well take the opportunity to move around.</p><p></p><p>Because in Su Hao's view, after completing the first and second items, his 'planetary network positioning and teleportation' technique was already a done deal.</p><p></p><p>Writing software! That was his forte.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao walked slowly in the second-level world, the environment he had modified was still there, well taken care of by Feng Cheng, looking even more vibrant than twenty years ago.</p><p></p><p>Strolling in such a celestial realm made Su Hao's body and mind feel relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The dull feeling of being alone in the experimental small world for over twenty years gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, sensing Su Hao had come out, also crawled out.</p><p></p><p>Although they often chatted idly in the group, in reality they had not seen each other for over twenty years...</p><p></p><p>They could be called old friends who had not seen each other for many years.</p><p></p><p>Time, inexplicably, became worthless.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Since you've also come out, let's have a banquet, race cars, and play cards!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After relaxing for a few days, Su Hao entered the pinball space and began writing the program.</p><p></p><p>He quickly entered a highly focused state again.</p><p></p><p>Establishing the database, building data retrieval functions, connecting the spiritual tentacle perception channel...</p><p></p><p>He could complete each task at an extremely fast pace.</p><p></p><p>But once he delved into research, time just ticked away.</p><p></p><p>After completing the construction of the automatic recognition program, another five years passed in a blur.</p><p></p><p>What he did not expect was that just building a program took five years without realizing it.</p><p></p><p>The reason it took so long was that while the program was easy to build, the automatic recognition function was not easy to handle.</p><p></p><p>It was this point that consumed five years of Su Hao's effort.</p><p></p><p>That day, Su Hao came to the vast space again, activated the formation on his crystal armor, and successfully connected to the 'planetary network' through the blue crystal in his cranium.</p><p></p><p>A large number of 'mini-selves' scattered out, arriving on different planets in the 'planetary network'.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao randomly selected a planet, and a large number of 'mini-selves' converged on the planet's surface, finding a huge rock.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the 'mini-selves' observed the rock from various angles and deep inside, examining its composition.</p><p></p><p>Rapidly calculating 'volume', 'mass', 'structure'...</p><p></p><p>The calculated data was input into another program, simulating the spatial curvature model, and then calculating the oscillation changes of the spatial module where this rock was located...</p><p></p><p>In a moment, a result was obtained.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's numerous spiritual tentacles stretched out, carefully sensing this twisted, profound space, probing everywhere. After who knows how long, a small light circled a small red dot in a strange place...</p><p></p><p>And this was the location of the huge rock that the small light determined through comparison, with extremely high accuracy.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Su Hao found the location.</p><p></p><p>After completing this step, the next part was very simple.</p><p></p><p>'Teleport'!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Su Hao disappeared from his original spot!</p><p></p><p>And below him was indeed that huge rock.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao let out a long breath, somewhat excitedly: "Success! My approach is feasible!"</p><p></p><p>He had already foreseen such a scenario, but after the experiment succeeded, he still could not help feeling excited.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try again!"</p><p></p><p>The 'mini-selves' in the 'planetary world' randomly picked another planet and found a stable location on it.</p><p></p><p>Activating the scanning program, analyzing the data, obtaining the result.</p><p></p><p>Then his vast spiritual tentacles stretched out, constantly searching until the small light marked the corresponding spatial module.</p><p></p><p>'Teleport'!</p><p></p><p>Success again.</p><p></p><p>Succeeding in teleporting twice in a row gave Su Hao full confidence, basically confirming the 'planetary network positioning and teleportation' technique was a success.</p><p></p><p>However, from the preparation for 'teleporting' to the end, the time required was unstable and difficult to control, which made Su Hao feel a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>The speed of planetary network teleportation was affected by the speeds of the 'scanning program', 'data analysis' and 'module searching'.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was the process of the spiritual tentacles 'searching for the module' - it could take just a few seconds if fast, or over ten minutes if slow.</p><p></p><p>However, he did find that the larger the volume of the selected object, the relatively shorter the time needed to search for the module.</p><p></p><p>So, could he find a way to shorten the planetary teleportation time?</p><p></p><p>He thought about it, then set this idea aside: "I'll think of a way to deal with the unstable teleportation time later! Being able to teleport successfully is already the best result. I won't be picky for now."</p><p></p><p>To make a new ability realize its full value, one needs to practice it until it becomes second nature.</p><p></p><p>Only then can it be used in various suitable scenarios.</p><p></p><p>And this is also a prerequisite for expanding more applications.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao once again selected a planet from the 'planetary network'.</p><p></p><p>'Teleport'!</p><p></p><p>'Teleport'!</p><p></p><p>'Teleport'!</p><p></p><p>He practiced like this for a year, as if possessed.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely through this repeated practice that he became extremely proficient and rapid in using 'planetary network positioning and teleportation'.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he truly felt his own immense power.</p><p></p><p>Unprecedented power!</p><p></p><p>To call this ability the ultimate pursuit of a 'planetary life' would not be an overstatement.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao teleported to a planet on the edge of the Cloud Ring System, gazing at the neighboring galaxy.</p><p></p><p>It did not seem too far away, but the distance between the two galaxies was at least four million light-years.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stretched out a hand towards the distant galaxy: "So, if I want to go there, what should I do?"</p>

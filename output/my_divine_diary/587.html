        <h1>Chapter 587</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lada and the others could no longer tell whether it was this world that was changing too fast, or if they had never truly understood this world.</p><p></p><p>They felt that everything they had encountered was too dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as captives, they felt the ultimate humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Originally the supreme rulers of the entire Hengxuan region, within just a few days they had become prisoners of others. This immense gap in status made them feel so miserable they nearly vomited blood.</p><p></p><p>Regrettably, they could not even vomit blood, as their entire bodies were tightly restrained. They couldn't even open their mouths to curse, let alone perform the complex action of vomiting blood.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the people had been captured, Su Hao turned to Ya Shan and said, "Ya Shan, go back first and set up the suppression formation."</p><p></p><p>"Got it, Captain Wei!" Ya Shan replied, his figure disappearing from the spot as he teleported back to base to set up the formation.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, a message came: "Captain Wei, it's ready!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually cast a 'Spatial Balance Technique', attaching it to Lada and the others, then teleported with them back to the base.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly finding themselves in an unfamiliar place, Lada couldn't help but let his eyes wander around.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself: "As expected, a spatial ability! This place, is it their headquarters? The stolen source artifacts Fei Yao mentioned are probably here. Perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>He had read many heroic tales, countless stories where the protagonist is captured by the villain but through chance is able to defeat them from the inside. This gave him a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I'm the protagonist of one of those stories, and in the end I'll be able to turn the tables and achieve victory!"</p><p></p><p>After handing the people over to Ya Shan, Su Hao said, "You can study them now, but be careful not to let them get the upper hand!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed, "Don't worry Captain Wei, if I let these few get the better of me after all these years, I might as well become a dog."</p><p></p><p>The big dog lying nearby couldn't help but raise its head and look at Ya Shan in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then asked, "What about locating the Royal Clan's positions? Have the thousand transit spheres been produced yet?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan replied, "Almost done, Feng Cheng can finish the remaining part in half a month."</p><p></p><p>"Send me a message when they're complete. We need to accomplish the goal as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Su Hao flickered back to his own laboratory.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan slowly exited his 'Command Trance' state, waving his hand to move Lada and the other five onto the experiment platform.</p><p></p><p>Lada and the others widened their eyes in shock, thinking to themselves: "So this is the true face of the Scourge of the Land Armor! So young...what is he going to do? Use us for experiments?"</p><p></p><p>Guessing the words 'use for experiments', a chill ran down their spines!</p><p></p><p>They were all too familiar with the inhumane treatment experimental subjects faced.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ya Shan chuckled lightly, "You all look so tense? Don't worry, relax, being an experimental subject isn't a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>After their source variables were suppressed by the inhibitors, the source variables didn't disappear directly, just had their amplitudes greatly suppressed back to ordinary human levels. Their original frequencies and waveforms remained essentially unchanged.</p><p></p><p>So the five whose source abilities were suppressed would not affect Ya Shan's analysis experiments.</p><p></p><p>He was confident he could replicate Lada's source abilities within half a month.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That day, Zhi Peng spoke to Feng Cheng again through Parrot No. 7.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the call connected, Zhi Peng said, "Mr. Jia Feng Cheng, how are your injuries? Don't get me wrong, I'm just asking out of concern!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng replied directly, "No need to worry, we've captured President Lada. You all can just do whatever you were going to do! You might as well take the opportunity to capture a few more cities while you're at it! That's all, goodbye!"</p><p></p><p>He hung up immediately after speaking.</p><p></p><p>Parrot No. 7 made a sound, "Hung up, hung up!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng looked utterly incredulous, "President Lada was captured by Mr. Jia Feng Cheng?"</p><p></p><p>At first he didn't really believe it, thinking Jia Feng Cheng was just brushing him off because he found him annoying, so he remained cautiously hidden.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until half a month later, when there were no more reports of President Lada's brutal killings in the areas around the Radiance Society's territory, that he finally believed Lada had truly been captured.</p><p></p><p>But there was still a sense of unreality - the so-called 'invincible' master had just been captured like that?</p><p></p><p>Being captured was even harder to believe than being killed!</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Zhi Peng received a message from Su Hao: "Zhi Peng, I've located most of the positions of the Royal Clan. In half a month, the Radiance Society needs to use transit spheres to completely eradicate the Royal Clan in the Hengxuan region within a day. There are over 700 locations in total. You need to make preparations in advance.</p><p></p><p>I'll give you the specific locations and transit spheres later. Have people quickly set up the transit spheres. That's it!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng was stunned again.</p><p></p><p>What was this operation? Just launch a full-scale attack like that?</p><p></p><p>But regardless, he still followed Su Hao's orders and began mobilizing forces, carefully delegating the tasks level by level.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a month, Zhi Peng had made tactical arrangements for the squads and triple-checked that there were no errors. He then replied to Su Hao: "Mr. Jia Wei, the Radiance Society is prepared and ready to depart at any time."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Proceed as planned. Take action precisely at night three days from now."</p><p></p><p>It was at this point that Zhi Peng's feelings became extremely complex, not feeling the expected joy of eradicating the Royal Clan.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he felt an immense weight of pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Let the light shine upon the land...after eradicating the Royal Clan, will the Radiance Society truly be able to let light shine upon the land? Years later, will the Radiance Society become like the current Royal Clan, or even more inhumane..."</p><p></p><p>That night, Zhi Peng couldn't sleep. He thought a lot, realizing that no matter how the future unfolded, such things would be unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>"So what is the meaning of me doing all this?"</p><p></p><p>In the end, he sighed helplessly, "Let the people of the future deal with the future!"</p><p></p><p>Having come this far, there was no turning back. He would not allow himself the slightest bit of hesitation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Su Hao teleported to the main city of Yixuan in the Hengxuan region, hovering high in the air and looking down on this massive, brightly lit city.</p><p></p><p>In the center was an enormous imperial palace, illuminated through the night, heavily guarded - no buildings were allowed within 500 meters of the palace walls, nor could any outsiders approach.</p><p></p><p>Every night at least 500 source masters led troops patrolling back and forth. Not the slightest movement could escape their eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was a place the Radiance Society could not capture, even if they expended all their strength. And even if they did, the losses would be devastating.</p><p></p><p>Not only here, but also the many princes' palaces scattered around Yixuan City. Though not as grand as the imperial palace, they were still massive structures.</p><p></p><p>The defenses of these princes' palaces were equally strict. Even a sneak attack would not easily capture them.</p><p></p><p>These cities with powerfully defended palaces were the three most difficult targets in the entire Hengxuan region. Su Hao, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng would each handle one.</p><p></p><p>The Radiance Society was tasked with clearing areas with relatively weaker defenses.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's group's method of clearing the Royal Clan was simple: activate the source vector suppression devices to blanket the entire city, then kill everyone in the imperial palace and bury the entire palace deep underground.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao estimated the time was near. Countless tiny crystals spontaneously generated around him, coalescing into a massive array platform. Infusing it with spiritual power, the array flashed white.</p><p></p><p>The suppression device activated!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the massive city fell silent for a moment, then descended into mild chaos.</p><p></p><p>Two source masters battling in the arena suddenly lost their abilities mid-fight, no matter how they tried. The innate source power they had used as easily as breathing was gone, reduced to ordinary human levels. The two opponents looked at each other speechlessly.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Suddenly can't use abilities anymore, is it the opponent's trick? No, it seems they can't use theirs either! Should we go up and fight hand-to-hand? I'm much bigger, I'd have the advantage..."</p><p></p><p>But why did their minds feel so empty and unsettled?</p><p></p><p>On the street, a source master performing an illusory "Dream World" for children tried repeatedly, finally having to admit his abilities had failed.</p><p></p><p>He could only force a smile, "Not in good form today, let's do it again tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Then he disappeared into the crowd under the children's disappointed gazes.</p><p></p><p>Countless source masters discovered in an instant that they had suddenly lost control of their source power. Fear immediately took over their souls.</p><p></p><p>"Why is this happening? I've...lost everything?"</p><p></p><p>"There must be some problem, I'll definitely be able to use it again. Let me try another source gem!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The chaos only lasted a short while before quickly subsiding.</p><p></p><p>No one wanted others to know their abilities had failed. Source masters had enemies too - if their foes found out, who knows what they might do in a moment of recklessness?</p><p></p><p>After 'scanning' and calculating trajectories, each flying sword locked onto its target, most aimed at the imperial palace, the rest at the various princes' palaces.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>The brilliant golden swords erupted downwards.</p><p></p><p>'Myriad Swords Strike'!</p><p></p><p>The citizens of Yixuan City couldn't help but look up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>They saw countless golden streaks raining down, the unique golden light filling the night sky.</p><p></p><p>So beautiful!</p>

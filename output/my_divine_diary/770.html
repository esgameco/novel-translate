        <h1>Chapter 770</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, there are three elements that signify the emergence of civilization: the appearance of metal tools, the invention of writing, and the formation of the state.</p><p></p><p>However, the criteria Su Hao used to search for civilization in the universe were not the same.</p><p></p><p>The only sign of civilization he sought was the accumulation of unique 'knowledge' specific to that planet in the universe.</p><p></p><p>For nearly a thousand years, he had traveled through various galaxies in search of the core meaning of life, which was to seek more 'knowledge'.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if this knowledge was not edited and recorded in writing, it didn't matter, because for Su Hao, it was fine if it was recorded within the bodies of living beings.</p><p></p><p>After all, as long as there were some unique aspects, with his current abilities he could fully analyze and extract them through experiments.</p><p></p><p>And his expectation for this yellow-blue planet was nothing more than that.</p><p></p><p>He hoped that the life on this planet possessed unique qualities that could bring him something new.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao appeared, Feng Cheng concealed his form first, and led Su Hao and Ya Shan flying in one direction.</p><p></p><p>While moving, he explained: "Master Wei, Master Ya Shan, there are no humanoid intelligent lifeforms on this planet. At first glance, I thought it was just like the previous planet, merely a planet with prehistoric creatures.</p><p></p><p>However, after careful observation, I discovered something special on the highest mountain range of this planet.</p><p></p><p>Around the peaks of the highest mountain range, there is a continuous stretch of nests, where a large number of creatures with twin horns on their heads and dragon-like winged bodies gather, able to fly freely and flexibly in the sky.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, I thought it was just a gathering place for local unique creatures.</p><p></p><p>But upon closer inspection, wow, these winged dragons were actually wearing clothes and armor..."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was not too clear about the rest, because as soon as he discovered this planet, he immediately notified Su Hao and Ya Shan, without having more time to investigate further details of this world.</p><p></p><p>After Feng Cheng's explanation, Su Hao and Ya Shan immediately determined that this world must possess a certain level of civilization.</p><p></p><p>When the three approached the mountain range, they stopped within the limit of their spiritual sense's coverage, using it to observe from afar without rashly advancing and alarming the native creatures of this world.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Let's first enter the 'Planetary Network' to conduct a comprehensive search and record of this planet, and grasp the basic situation before making a decision."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could wait for hundreds or thousands of years, so he didn't mind taking some time for reconnaissance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since the three of them had come here, this planet was destined to offer them precious knowledge, and could not escape.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>The three dispersed and accessed the 'Planetary Network', beginning their investigation across this planet.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>This yellow-blue planet was immense, comparable to the cultivation planet Su Hao had visited before, and was called the 'Holy Land of Divine Grace' by its inhabitants.</p><p></p><p>This name originated from the world's highest peak, the 'Holy Mountain of Divine Grace'.</p><p></p><p>On the Holy Mountain of Divine Grace, there was a special purple spring called the 'Mother Goddess Pool'.</p><p></p><p>A race calling themselves the 'Winged Gods' regarded the Mother Goddess Pool as their own, guarding it for a long time and not allowing any outsiders to set foot there.</p><p></p><p>This was because the Winged Gods obtained unimaginable power from the Mother Goddess Pool.</p><p></p><p>This power not only allowed them to occupy this unique mountain range, but also gave them strength far surpassing other races, reigning supreme like gods, with none able to obstruct them.</p><p></p><p>They then proclaimed themselves as the most noble 'Divine Race' of the 'Holy Land of Divine Grace', and viewed the other three coexisting races as their slaves, destined to serve them forever!</p><p></p><p>There were four different races living in the Holy Land of Divine Grace, all coexisting on one planet, with the strongest calling the shots and the weaker having to accept their fate.</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as the Winged Gods properly guarded the 'Mother Goddess Pool' and prevented the other three races from accessing it, they could remain the divine race forever.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>When the Winged Gods' civilization reached a certain level, a revolution in thought disrupted this balance.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, some Winged Gods developed compassion, unable to bear the eternal suffering of the other three races as slaves, and advocated for equality among all races...</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, this strange ideology was considered progressive by many Winged Gods and highly admired.</p><p></p><p>As it developed further, some Winged Gods became traitors, condemned as 'Fallen Gods' by the orthodox Winged Gods.</p><p></p><p>And the water of the Mother Goddess Pool mysteriously spread outward.</p><p></p><p>The situation became complicated and spiraled out of control.</p><p></p><p>On the Holy Mountain of Divine Grace.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Lord, the Fallen God Yuan Tan, leading the armies of the Tyrant Dragons, Spirit Dragons, and Rock Dragons, has surrounded our Holy Shrine of Divine Grace. They will likely launch an attack soon."</p><p></p><p>A peculiar language and pronunciation echoed on the highest peak of the Holy Mountain of Divine Grace.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the palace cave on the peak, a Winged God over ten meters long stood on the central throne.</p><p></p><p>On its ferocious dragon head grew two steel-like horns, and two golden vertical pupils emitted a cold light. Its slightly open mouth revealed rows of neat, sharp teeth that could easily bite through ten dog heads.</p><p></p><p>This Winged God's entire body was covered in intricate armor with a silvery-white luster, appearing extremely sturdy, comparable to the alloys used in spacecraft construction.</p><p></p><p>Where the armor did not cover, black dragon scales glistened dimly under the firelight.</p><p></p><p>This was the highest power and authority holder of the Winged God race, the Winged God Holy Lord.</p><p></p><p>It slowly raised its head.</p><p></p><p>"Ding ding ding!"</p><p>"Crack crack crack!"</p><p></p><p>The sounds of metal scales colliding on its long neck made the many prostrated Winged Gods shudder and look up.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Lord spoke, "All Fallen Gods are a disgrace to us Winged Gods, and I shall personally crush them to death.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Mountain of Divine Grace is our Winged Gods' sacred land, and no outsiders shall be allowed to defile it.</p><p></p><p>Swear to guard the holy mountain with your lives, and follow me to slaughter all invading enemies at the foot of the mountain."</p><p></p><p>Its tone was calm, but all Winged Gods could sense the Holy Lord's barely containable rage.</p><p></p><p>"Roar——"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Lord let out a sky-rending roar, then stretched out its claw to casually grab an extraordinarily large hammer from the side, leapt into the air, spread its wings, and flew out of the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Roar—— Roar——"</p><p></p><p>The smaller Winged Dragons in the palace imitated it, roaring skyward before flying out.</p><p></p><p>Then the surrounding mountains became lively, as numerous Winged Gods took flight from various peaks and gathered in the sky, forming a dense swarm like startled birds.</p><p></p><p>After taking flight, they raised their heads and roared.</p><p></p><p>"Roar——"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the continuous Holy Mountain Range resounded with the howls of the Winged Gods, their morale instantly reaching its peak.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Lord swung the heavy long-handled hammer rapidly, revealing a ferocious grin on its massive head, then suddenly dove down towards the three-race allied army at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>It roared in a voice filled with majesty, "The glory of the Winged Gods reigns supreme! My noble children, follow me to utterly annihilate all the rabble who dare challenge the Winged Gods!"</p><p></p><p>Its voice was immense, like thunderous roars from the sky, carrying far so that all the Winged Gods flying could hear it clearly.</p><p></p><p>The Winged Gods became agitated again, roaring as they dove after the Holy Lord, their momentum like a rainbow.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>At the same time, frenzied roars also came from the foot of the Holy Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The army composed of the Tyrant Dragons, Spirit Dragons, and Rock Dragons surged like a steel torrent, submerging the entire mountain base.</p><p></p><p>Each one wore sturdy armor, wielding various weapons and shields that they waved skyward while shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>"All dragons are born equal, what's the difference between 'gods' and 'dragons'?"</p><p></p><p>"There are no divine races in this world, only the dragon race."  </p><p></p><p>"We'll fight for our freedom with the weapons in our hands."</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Mountain belongs to the entire world, not just the Winged Dragons."</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Dragons were the most powerful comprehensive race of the four, similar to prehistoric tyrant lizards, possessing both strength and speed as the absolute rulers of the land. They were also the main force of this allied army.</p><p></p><p>If not for their lack of wings to fly, they might have been able to rival the Winged Gods in the sky.  </p><p></p><p>The Spirit Dragons were small and slender, but incredibly agile and swift, able to unleash formidable power in certain environments despite their size.</p><p></p><p>The Rock Dragons were the largest, covered in thick armor plating. Though slow, their strength was immense. Each carried various giant weapons, with the crossbow being the most common.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, they had come prepared to face the Winged Gods.</p><p></p><p>For the three races, victory in this battle was a must!</p><p></p><p>"The Winged God race will become history. In the future, there will only be the Winged Dragon race, not the Winged God race!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Interestingly, the leader of the Tyrant Dragon, Spirit Dragon, and Rock Dragon allied army was a massive Winged God.</p><p></p><p>It was the 'Fallen God Yuan Tan' as the Winged Gods called it.</p>

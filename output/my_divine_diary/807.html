        <h1>Chapter 807</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo did not rush to return and search for the lost bisons. Instead, she searched within the cave.</p><p></p><p>Soon she confirmed that there were indeed traces of humans having been in the nest.</p><p></p><p>From the various dragon-catching devices left behind in the nest, she judged that these humans had come to steal the baby dragons.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, despite her utmost precautions, the "dragon thieves" had still found the location of her nest.</p><p></p><p>It had only been a little over a month since the first baby dragon hatched...</p><p></p><p>Compared to the thirty-year growth period for baby dragons, her children had just been born when they were discovered and targeted by humans.</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo blamed herself greatly for this, feeling she was not a good mother.</p><p></p><p>She was immensely relieved that her three children were still in the cave, not taken away by the human "dragon thieves."</p><p></p><p>A doubt arose: "What happened during the time I was away? Those humans had indeed entered the nest, so logically speaking, there was no reason for my children to be spared..."</p><p></p><p>She first looked at her eldest son Chipu and second daughter Moli, who were still wandering around her, looking clueless while searching for food.</p><p></p><p>She thought to herself: "These two foolish children, I probably can't get any information from them."</p><p></p><p>Then she looked at her youngest Leian: "As expected of my child Shaduo, you are truly brilliant beyond compare."</p><p></p><p>After calming her mixed emotions of anxiety and joy, Mother Dragon Shaduo asked: "Leian, my child, what happened at home while I was away? What's the story behind these ropes and evil devices out there?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao explained extremely briefly: "Shaduo mother, not long after you left, many...upright creatures? Rushed in, tied up Chipu and Moli, but I took care of all of them."</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo exclaimed in surprise: "Those were human 'dragon thieves' with formidable power, and you took care of all of them?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo felt a sense of unreality and asked Su Hao some more detailed questions, but he brushed them off vaguely. The core point was "The enemy was powerful, but I was more powerful. I defeated them and threw them out."</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud Valley Mountains where all kinds of ferocious giant soul beasts roamed, it was very normal for discarded corpses to leave no trace.</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao explained, he also briefly demonstrated his current speed and strength, simulating the scene from back then.</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon listened to Su Hao's earnest account, but did not gain anything more useful. She only knew that indeed a group of "dragon thieves" had rushed into the nest, intending to kidnap her three children.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Su Hao's account, Mother Dragon Shaduo felt lingering fear and tightly embraced her three baby dragons.</p><p></p><p>It was not until her eldest son Chipu said "Shaduo mother, I'm hungry" that she snapped out of her daze, falling back into a dilemma.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, she no longer dared to leave the three baby dragons alone in the cave.</p><p></p><p>But taking the three baby dragons with her was even more dangerous. If something happened, she might not be able to protect the baby dragons successfully.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of hesitation, she decided to first scout the area around the nest, then go search for the lost bisons, thinking: "After the children eat, I'll immediately take them away from here and find a more secluded place."</p><p></p><p>As for whether those bisons would run away...</p><p></p><p>She joked to herself, falling from such a height, even being able to cling to life would mean that bison was tough. If they were carried away by other ferocious beasts, it didn't matter either - those beasts would serve well to let the children taste something fresh.</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo wavered, but eventually flew out of the nest to scout the surroundings. After confirming no humans were hiding nearby, she returned to find the lost bisons.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she brought back four plump bisons.</p><p></p><p>While Su Hao and the three baby dragons were eating, Mother Dragon Shaduo stood at the cave entrance, gazing outwards through the crevice, thinking to herself: "Where should we move to? The world is so vast, where is a safe dwelling place?"</p><p></p><p>She had lived in the Cloud Valley Mountains for many years and quickly came up with a few alternative locations. However, she was not confident about the safety of those places, always worried that humans would find them.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to find a place rarely visited by humans, but after considering it, she realized the answer was "nowhere."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night fell, and Mother Dragon placed the three baby dragons on her back. Then, under the cover of night, she flew out of the nest, heading north.</p><p></p><p>The starry sky shone down, making this night not seem too dark, allowing the vague outlines of the mountains below to be seen.</p><p></p><p>The high-altitude night winds blew fiercely. The supposedly sleepy eldest son Chipu and second daughter Moli were now excitedly looking around while lying on Mother Dragon Shaduo's back. Their short wings on their backs imitated Mother Dragon, spreading open to catch the wind, flapping to simulate flying - not a hint of sleepiness.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Hao, he didn't care where they stayed, as long as it was a relatively safe environment that allowed him to fully recover his strength.</p><p></p><p>Currently, although he had reached the Yuan Ying realm and basically recovered some of his core powers, without entering the second-level world to act through a spiritual clone, it was still not very secure.</p><p></p><p>After all, he knew nothing about the nature of soul power and soul arts in this world, or the highest level of combat strength.</p><p></p><p>So for now, it was better to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao kept his eyes open, watching the night scenery along the way, occasionally looking up at the brilliant starry sky, his mind inevitably drawn to the beautiful starlight.</p><p></p><p>"The starlight looks about the same everywhere, each star representing an immense galaxy...I wonder what level the human civilization in the distant Cloud Ring System has reached after hundreds of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>It would be nice if I could go back and take a look. Unfortunately, with each reincarnation, all I carry are my consciousness and recorded knowledge. Everything else has left no trace.</p><p></p><p>Heh, I really am insatiable. Isn't this place, among the starry skies I longed for in my previous life, a planet with human civilization? This is the best planet, I should be content and joyful."</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao lay on Mother Dragon Shaduo's back, letting his thoughts wander, a strong sense of satisfaction enveloped his heart, and he gained some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"No matter where I am, I am part of the cosmic starry sky. Everywhere I go is my one and only place."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Su Hao's mouth slowly curved into a smile, joy shining on his dragon face.</p><p></p><p>While the eldest Chipu and second Moli played around, they constantly paid attention to Su Hao's every move - a habit they had developed recently, because they found their third younger brother always had inexhaustible wonders that intrigued them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao smile now, they also giggled foolishly, then carefully moved closer to him on the dragon's back.</p><p></p><p>The eldest Chipu said indistinctly while braving the wind: "Third brother, let's fly together."</p><p></p><p>He then showed Su Hao his two short wings on his back, flapping them hard a few times.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's smile gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, after many years, he felt the helplessness of interacting with young children again.</p><p></p><p>He, an ancient monster who had lived nearly ten thousand years, how could he play with these two baby dragons?</p><p></p><p>Even if he regressed to a childlike mentality, it still wouldn't work...</p><p></p><p>After flying for about five hours, Mother Dragon Shaduo finally couldn't persist any longer. She found a mountaintop to rest, folding her tired wings while panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was stunned: "A mighty dragon actually has such poor flight endurance..."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a faint yellow glow emanated from Mother Dragon Shaduo's body, sinking back in before quickly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao curiously asked, "Shaduo mother, what was that, a soul art?"</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo's breathing gradually steadied, as if her fatigue was rapidly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Su Hao's inquiry, she smiled and said, "This is a simple soul art that can alleviate fatigue to a certain extent, allowing me to fly for longer periods.</p><p></p><p>However, using soul arts generally releases a faint glow, attracting unnecessary attention. Now that we're traveling stealthily at night, I normally wouldn't use it."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao understood. If not for Mother Dragon Shaduo's extreme exhaustion, she would not have used a soul art to dispel her fatigue. Having nearly lost her children, she treasured the three babies dearly and would do her utmost to conceal their tracks.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, without soul art augmentation, the dragon's endurance was worrying. Carrying three baby dragons, she could only fly for a little over five hours...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao turned to look at the wings on his back, thinking to himself: "These wings don't seem very useful either."</p><p></p><p>After resting for about ten minutes, Mother Dragon headed north again.</p><p></p><p>Another five hours later, as the sky began to brighten, they finally reached their destination - a seaside cliff.</p>

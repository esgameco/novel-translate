        <h1>Chapter 804</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought about it, stepped forward and walked up to Weiya. Under her terrified expression, he raised his claw in a striking motion and placed it in front of her forehead.</p><p></p><p>He flicked it lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>A dull sound rang out, as if Weiya's forehead had been struck by a huge hammer. Her body flew backwards uncontrollably and crashed heavily onto the ground, falling unconscious.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this out of the corner of their eyes, the others couldn't help but swallow hard in fright, feeling their legs go weak.</p><p></p><p>The bearded leader of the Fugold squad, Xibo, didn't need to look to know what had happened behind him. He couldn't help but feel despair: "It's over! We're probably going to die today, maybe even become the dragon's droppings...</p><p></p><p>The widely spread saying 'Those who steal from dragons shall die by dragon claws' turns out to be true. Indeed, before death truly descends, everyone thinks they are the special exception.</p><p></p><p>But, I've lived a brilliant life without regrets!"</p><p></p><p>Among the many human professions, 'dragon thief' was quite popular, but due to the high danger and technical requirements, not many became dragon thieves.</p><p></p><p>The Fugold squad happened to be one of the relatively famous 'dragon thief squads' among humans, and as the leader, he had reason to be proud.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this bizarre red-gold young dragon did not kill the Fugold squad members. After confirming they could not move, it turned around, returned to find a comfortable spot and lay down...</p><p></p><p>Judging by its closed eyes, it seemed to be napping!</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Inexplicably, a glimmer of hope emerged in the bearded Xibo's heart: "The young dragon hasn't rushed to kill us, no matter what its intentions are... which means there's still a chance to survive. So what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>He tried to calm his thoughts, searching for that slim chance: "Don't disturb it. After it falls asleep, quietly break through this crystal restraint and escape... Yes, we must escape before the mother dragon returns!"</p><p></p><p>As for Suhao, he was naturally not sleeping, but had entered the Bouncing Realm to check his current state.</p><p></p><p>He had just woken up and hadn't had a chance to examine the situation with his genetic modifications.</p><p></p><p>As for these humans, he naturally wouldn't just kill them, because he still had great use for them.</p><p></p><p>"The genetic modifications were largely successful, with some minor issues that can be fixed when I advance to Grandmaster Warrior in a month. Now, I need to find a place to properly secure these humans, otherwise when the mother dragon returns, she'll probably just swallow them whole."</p><p></p><p>The best place to secure them would be his second-level space, but without advancing to Grandmaster Warrior, without the core runes imprinted within his body to coordinate, he temporarily cannot flexibly use spatial abilities...</p><p></p><p>Suhao pondered briefly and found a solution: "Since I can't obtain the core runes temporarily, I can use the Adamantine Shell to simulate and construct a temporary set of core runes within my body. I'll use these for now, and in a month when I advance, I'll use genetic imprinting instead."</p><p></p><p>When he was still human, this step was difficult to achieve because without core runes linking the entire blood energy into a vast system to drastically increase the blood energy quantity, the blood energy of even an elite warrior was insufficient to support operating the core runes.</p><p></p><p>So the normal process should be imprinting a set of core runes within the body first, advancing to Grandmaster Warrior to obtain a massive blood energy quantity, allowing the core runes to function smoothly...</p><p></p><p>But now that he was in the body of a red-gold young dragon, from constantly refining himself during this period, his blood energy quantity was comparable to a Grandmaster Warrior's, enough for him to freely expend.</p><p></p><p>"Where should I imprint this temporary core rune array?" </p><p></p><p>Suhao turned to examine his body, quickly settling on that long tail: "This tail, apart from being used to hit Chipu and Moli, has no other use. I'll just modify the inside into a rune array!"</p><p></p><p>Having decided, he immediately began designing the tail's rune array within the Bouncing Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Above the cliff crevice, the two Fugold squad members who stayed behind waited and waited, but received no news from the bearded Xibo and the others, leaving them puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Hey Skinny, how long has Captain Xibo and the others been down there?"</p><p></p><p>"It should be about an hour now."</p><p></p><p>"I reckon it's been an hour too, but does catching a few red-gold young dragons really need this much time? Previously when we did this, it took at most ten minutes before we got the retreat signal, right? It never exceeded twenty minutes."</p><p></p><p>Skinny pondered: "Now that you mention it, they have taken longer this time. Could there have been some accident?"</p><p></p><p>"An accident...or maybe they encountered more young dragons this time, causing the delay."</p><p></p><p>"There's no reason for such a long delay. Even if there were more young dragons, they should have signaled to withdraw within half an hour. You think maybe they did signal to withdraw, but we just didn't happen to hear it?"</p><p></p><p>"With four ears between us, you think it's possible we both missed it?"</p><p></p><p>"What I mean is, maybe the whistle they blew was too soft, and it just didn't reach our ears."</p><p></p><p>"Then how about this - I'll blow the whistle to ask what's going on. If there's a reply, good. If not, it means they really did go down with the young dragons, and we should retreat first!"</p><p></p><p>Skinny thought it over and nodded: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>So the two went to the cliff edge and blew hard on the whistles in their mouths, the crisp, melodious whistling echoing rhythmically through the mountain valley crevice, like the mating calls of birds.</p><p></p><p>The whistling reverberated endlessly, entering the dragon's lair and Xibo's ears.</p><p></p><p>Causing the dazed Xibo to jolt in shock, a surge of wild joy rising in his heart: "That's right, Skinny and the other one are still up there. If they know our situation, they'll definitely think of a way to rescue us. But how do I contact them?"</p><p></p><p>However, to Xibo's helplessness, he had no means to contact those two squad members, and could only pray silently that they would come down to investigate...</p><p></p><p>Skinny and the other listened intently, but after waiting for a long time with no response, their thoughts churned: "No reply, there are two possibilities. First: Captain Xibo and the others did indeed go down with the red-gold young dragons, and didn't hear the signal we sent, meaning they can pack up the ropes and leave. Second: Captain Xibo and the others have met with some mishap...</p><p></p><p>Of the two possibilities, it's more likely that Captain Xibo met with trouble, because even if they wanted to go down with the young dragons, they would need to untie the ropes here and lower them down first. With just their equipment, it would be very difficult to successfully bring the young dragons down to the bottom of the cliff...</p><p></p><p>Regardless, we must leave first. If Captain Xibo and the others have left, we'll find them once we're out. If we can't find them after going out, then the captain and others must have met with trouble.</p><p></p><p>In that case, we can sell the location of the red-gold young dragon lair and earn a tidy sum. Perfect!"</p><p></p><p>The two minds spun rapidly, but their expressions remained impassive.</p><p></p><p>They made eye contact, their understanding perfect without a word said.</p><p></p><p>Skinny smiled: "Looks like Captain Xibo and the others have already gone back. Let's go too!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, let's return to the Heaven's Prairie Base and wait for the captain and others!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>As for the ropes here, neither of them mentioned it as they swiftly departed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Within the dragon's lair.</p><p></p><p>"Kachakachaka~"</p><p></p><p>Sounds of crystallizing came from Suhao's tail, but there was no visible abnormality on the outside.</p><p></p><p>These sounds drew the attention of the Fugold squad members, frozen like crystal sculptures, unable to stop their eyes from searching for the source.</p><p></p><p>It was coming from that red-gold young dragon.</p><p></p><p>Could this red-gold young dragon be made of crystal?</p><p></p><p>This caused everyone's sphincters to tighten in fear of urinating: This crystal young dragon has had its fill... We're done for, it's definitely going to devour us clean this time. We're really done for.</p><p></p><p>After standing up, Suhao casually activated the 'Perception' rune he had imprinted on his tail.  </p><p></p><p>The perception rune lit up slightly, then dimmed, and simultaneously all living beings within a radius of over six thousand meters entered Suhao's perception, before gradually dissipating.</p><p></p><p>But those two seconds of perception were enough.</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned slightly upwards: "There are two aura reactions similar to these people up there, probably their companions. No need to rush, they can't escape. Let me test out the 'Spatial Module Generation' and 'Negative Space Module Positioning' runes I imprinted first."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Suhao flashed in a rhythm that seemed naturally ingrained in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>'Flash'!</p><p></p><p>Suhao couldn't help but break into a brilliant smile: "Barely passable, but usable!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1002</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Last October when the book started, until this September, it's been a full year.</p><p></p><p>The first year as a writer felt pretty good.</p><p></p><p>The reason for the birth of this book 'My Becoming a God Log' was actually just a thought of mine.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, a question suddenly popped into my mind: Are there really gods in this universe?</p><p></p><p>If so, who would be the first god?  </p><p></p><p>And how was the first god born?</p><p></p><p>It was these few questions that gave me the idea to write a novel about the 'first god'.</p><p></p><p>Then in my perception (note, this is my perception, different people have different perceptions), the path that Su Hao walked, the things he mastered, were more or less what the 'first god' should possess.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Many readers said there was still a lot that could be written, that's true, as long as I keep drinking water every day, there will always be things I can't finish writing...</p><p></p><p>But after all, this is the story of Su Hao's growth into the universe's 'first god'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao has achieved his goal, the story about him is basically complete, so this book should end.</p><p></p><p>Of course, you can think I can't continue writing it too.</p><p></p><p>There were also readers who suggested discovering new civilizations in the universe for Su Hao to fight against, unfolding an earth-shattering great war.</p><p></p><p>Ahem!</p><p></p><p>What I'm doing is not forgetting my original intention.</p><p></p><p>What I wrote about was the birth of the universe's 'first god'. If I suddenly added an extremely powerful opponent for Su Hao to fight against, then the Becoming a God Log I wrote over this past year would basically be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Again, thank you all readers for your support.</p><p></p><p>Great Sage kowtows in thanks, does an awkward dance of thanks, cross-dresses in thanks...</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>As for the new book, it's expected to start in October. I hope all readers will check it out then, and if you find it to your taste, cast a vote to support it or something.</p><p></p><p>Finally.</p><p></p><p>This book normally concludes according to the outline, with nine being the ultimate number, divided into nine volumes, 999 chapters in total.</p><p></p><p>Volume 1 'Secrets of Flesh and Blood'</p><p>Volume 2 'Secrets of Genes' </p><p>Volume 3 'Secrets of Bouncing Balls'</p><p>Volume 4 'Secrets of Space'</p><p>Volume 5 'Secrets of Energy'</p><p>Volume 6 'Secrets of Combustion' </p><p>Volume 7 'Secrets of the Mind'</p><p>Volume 8 'Secrets of the Soul'</p><p>Volume 9 'Crossing the Tides, Universe's Rhythm'</p><p></p><p>I have to especially thank the great support from the nine alliance leaders: Ao Ao Tu Ao Ao, Xi Niao, Shi Shu Chun Liang, Jiu Ling Hou v5, Jian Ce Zhi Hang 95072252, Nan Tian Qi Du, Ta Luo Lan, Zheng Ban Jun Zi You, and Pa Qiu Qiu!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 889</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Su Hao's main consciousness suddenly opened his eyes, looking slightly surprised, "It's feasible, we can find traces of the cosmic currents from other star systems!"</p><p></p><p>However, not all star systems could sense the fluctuations of the cosmic currents. Only a portion of the star systems could detect the existence of the cosmic currents, and the farther away from the Crucis system, the more dispersed the currents became, making them harder to detect.</p><p></p><p>"Send clones to the farther star fields to observe the situation."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Su Hao first recorded the current map, then sent numerous clones into various star systems, connecting them into the void to observe the cosmic currents.</p><p></p><p>The result was: a small number of clones detected traces of the currents, but they were almost invisible.</p><p></p><p>Almost invisible meant that they could only sense there were traces of currents, but even using void perception, they could not observe its specific form, let alone map out the currents.</p><p></p><p>This left Su Hao deep in thought: "The range of the cosmic currents is even greater than I imagined, but it is limited. Perhaps it is hidden within a single star system. When I reached the edge of the Aquarius system, I could no longer detect the currents. This means the Calamity System may be formed by something within a star system, just like how I used energy and matter to construct the 'focus system' that can transform matter into origin within a certain range.</p><p></p><p>The Calamity System is an actual existing entity. Now I cannot see it, I can only guess its appearance and principles from the clues, but I may not have the corresponding knowledge, so it is difficult for me to guess the form and nature of the Calamity System.</p><p></p><p>However, as long as I can see it completely, I will definitely be able to confirm its form and nature."</p><p></p><p>He gazed into the distance at the Crucis system, his eyes shining brightly, murmuring: "I have thought of an ingenious way to simultaneously observe the cosmic currents of the entire universe. As long as the currents produced by the Crucis system are strong enough, I can use this method to map out the currents of the entire star system!"</p><p></p><p>"So, travelers, grow up and make trouble to your heart's content, release your desires!</p><p></p><p>And as long as I can gain something from it, I will cover up any destruction you cause.</p><p></p><p>Even if planets shatter and worlds are destroyed, I can still cover it up..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was not joking. He really could cover it up. Even if everyone in the world died because of it, he could reshape bodies for them and revive them.</p><p></p><p>After all, all intelligent beings on the Crucis system had now become life forms with souls. The death of the body did not mean complete death. As long as he collected their souls and put them into bodies, he could revive them on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Not only intelligent beings, but even some wild beasts in nature had also transformed into powerful soul beasts under the influence of the soul network. If Su Hao wished, these soul beasts could also be revived on the spot.</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao pondered, he couldn't help but think of the situations he encountered in the cultivation world and the origin world, and began to analyze: "In every world I was reborn into before, I went all out and almost completely changed the world's appearance. The intensity of energy I caused, the calamity of a hundred-year period, was merely small-scale destruction that I could easily handle now;</p><p></p><p>After that, there were calamities of over a thousand years, which could be avoided but were difficult to withstand with a physical body...</p><p></p><p>However, this was after all the impact I caused. Back then, I destroyed countless planets, so the energy contained in the calamity I faced was enormously beyond imagination, which was normal.</p><p></p><p>These current travelers obviously do not possess such ability. At most, they play some small games and make some small troubles, so I guess the calamities caused by the travelers in the period of one hundred years, five hundred years, or even a thousand years, will not be as strong as I imagined.</p><p></p><p>The calamity in the initial stage of the travelers now seems very powerful, but it is actually affected by my and Ah Shan Feng's previous activities. After nearly a thousand travelers have died, the impact is no longer so intense.</p><p></p><p>In other words, no matter how powerful a calamity the current travelers cause, I can easily handle it within five hundred years, and I can also try to handle a thousand-year calamity.</p><p></p><p>It's safe!"</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more confident Su Hao became. He eagerly hoped the travelers would start causing unrest immediately, remaking the world, going on adventures, and indulging their deepest desires without restraint.</p><p></p><p>Rule the world, travelers!</p><p></p><p>What form should he appear in? A genie's wish? Summoning the dragon with the seven dragon balls to revive the entire world? The Holy Grail War?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he couldn't help but turn his gaze to the two 'world wills' carefully nurtured by the eighteen deities.</p><p></p><p>"Two little seedlings, I'll give you some time. If it doesn't work out, I'll have to replace you with more insightful 'modern netizens'. I'm sure they would also like to have a fantasy adventure."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>With perfect timing, Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei's missions, after going through 'visiting', 'investigating', 'staking out', 'tracking', and 'capturing live targets', had now reached the final stage of 'annihilating the bandit gang'.</p><p></p><p>As the mission progressed, the situation of the two travelers became increasingly precarious, constantly facing immense danger.</p><p></p><p>During their mission, they 'unintentionally' exposed themselves and were targeted by the bandit gang. If they were not careful, the gang would find an opportunity to strike them a fatal blow.</p><p></p><p>Now, the bandit gang was closing in on these two little fellows who dared to meddle in their business, determined to brutally kill them within three days.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei were facing their final life-or-death battle against the bandit gang.</p><p></p><p>Just like an abnormally close movie climax, they were welcoming the final grand battle, the highlight of the entire heroic incident.</p><p></p><p>However, the deities who personally designed all this were extremely tense. If the Ten-Color Plate could sweat, it would surely be drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Up to this point, the incident had been within their design, but it was precisely because of this that they were so tense.</p><p></p><p>For they were acutely aware of the real danger Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei were facing. It was not at all fake, and one slight misstep could get them killed by the soul-awakened members of the bandit gang.</p><p></p><p>According to the Light-Bathing God Ease, false danger was not real danger and would not merge with the 'natural crisis'. Only the danger that could truly put the world will in a dead end would be merged by the 'natural crisis', and then amplified by it, becoming even more lethal.</p><p></p><p>So the current situation of the two world wills was extremely precarious, and they could die completely with one misstep. The only benefit of doing this was that the deities could clearly predict where the danger came from based on the course of events, instead of being completely clueless about how the world wills died as before.</p><p></p><p>It was at this critical moment that the deities rarely became serious and carefully analyzed the current situation.</p><p></p><p>"Put them in a dead end, and then let them be reborn. We must let the danger fully erupt and put the blade to the world wills' necks. Then, at the very moment when the blade is about to take the world wills' lives, we will unintentionally provide assistance to help them complete the counterattack and break through the 'natural crisis'. Lord Ease, your plan is truly ingenious, but I don't understand why the previous attempts all failed."</p><p></p><p>Ease calmly said, "Even the wisest may have one oversight. I am not omnipotent. A small variable can cause my plan to fail completely, which is normal. But now that we are all planning together, the result will be different. In my view, this crisis will surely be overcome smoothly."</p><p></p><p>"I hope so. After all, no one wants to write a 5,000-word self-criticism."</p><p></p><p>"With the current strength of the two wills, it is not enough to confront the bandit gang. The two wills are in an absolute disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I have detected abnormalities in the behavior of the bandit gang, indicating something unusual. Their power has become more ferocious, their thoughts more extreme, and they have acquired better weapons.</p><p></p><p>So it can be confirmed that the 'natural crisis' has indeed merged with the incident we have created.</p><p></p><p>Lords, let us initiate our final plan!"</p>

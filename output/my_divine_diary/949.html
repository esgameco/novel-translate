        <h1>Chapter 949</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Almost at the same moment, the project to open up the world passageway was launched towards all the Trial Stars within the Pot System, and it was also made known to the kings of the various clans of the 'great villains' who had long resided on the Trial Stars.</p><p></p><p>The kings of the various races were all travelers that Su Hao had cast onto the trial star a long time ago, and they had been reincarnated thereafter, and had survived all kinds of hardships and dangers, finally growing up to become the strongest kings in the world and living for many years after being eliminated by Yashan.</p><p></p><p>They had long since treated this planet, this land, as their own domain, not allowing others to step on it.</p><p></p><p>And now that a group of people had inexplicably run out, and were actually doing it in the heat of their land, they simply didn't put them in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although the other party specialized in picking dangerous places like the Deep Mountain Trench where no one had ever set foot, as long as it was something on this planet, it was all theirs.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the kings were filled with curiosity about this group of people that had appeared from nowhere.</p><p></p><p>The Goblin King, dressed in a flashy outfit, stood on another high mountain surrounded by a group of smaller goblins, looking at the works in the distance, his eyes flickering as he said darkly, ''Where did these humans pop up from? How many years, this is the first time I have seen so many humans, and there are many beautiful young human girls ...... hissing inside, fantastic, if I can catch a few back, surely I can make up for the regrets of the virgins in my previous life ......</p><p></p><p>Crap, what am I thinking about~ Is this the time to think about such things? I need to find out what the other side is up to before I can do so. The thing I'm most afraid of is hitting on me, I haven't lived long enough!"</p><p></p><p>So the Goblin King dispatched his right-hand men to go up and explore, and not long after, the underling goblins came running back with their asses in the air.</p><p></p><p>The Goblin King's face was cloudy and uncertain, and finally said viciously, "How dare you ignore this king's existence, outrageous! Listen to my order ...... to retreat!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he disappeared invisibly without knowing where he was.</p><p></p><p>The Goblin King's powerful men then dispersed in a flurry.</p><p></p><p>On the other trial star, the Giant King patted his chest and roared to the sky, "I won't let them act recklessly, I won't let them succeed, I promise. All giant warriors, follow me!"</p><p></p><p>A few moments later, the Giant King knelt down with a bruised nose and said, "All you magnificent warriors, you seem to be doing something big, perhaps my clan can help in some small way."</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he said: "A great man can bend but not break, when I first penetrate into the enemy's inner circle, to find out the truth, and then make plans, one day, I will get back all of today's humiliation. I promise!"</p><p></p><p>The Hairy Tailed King of the Hairy Tailed Human Race looked at the distant construction site with a gloomy face, secretly saying, "No matter what the other party is doing, breaking the ring of the current balance, it will certainly not be a good thing for me, I can't let the other party reach their goal easily, as long as the time is stretched out, there are more opportunities to obtain useful information. Well ...... find a chance to catch one or two live mouths and ask them.</p><p></p><p>Then, what to do? The strength of the other party is unknown, and going forward rashly will not necessarily be able to gain benefits ...... There!"</p><p></p><p>He directly ordered: "Pass down the order, mobilize the elite troops, follow them after the project, they dig, we bury, dig how much to bury how much."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, revealing with a smug smile, the furry fox tail behind him rose slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Hoo~"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Hairy Tail King realized that there was an additional person beside him, and subconsciously wanted to launch an attack, but realized that he had been confined within a small space, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>His pupils shrunk, "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei laughed, "Still want to bury it? Stay aside."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he casually slapped his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Snap!"</p><p></p><p>The spherical space that imprisoned the Hairy Tailed King along with the Hairy Tailed King was sent flying with a slap and disappeared at the end of the field of vision.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling did not participate in the direct construction of this project, but rather acted as a controller, monitoring the situation of each sub-unit at all times in order to deal with unexpected situations.</p><p></p><p>"Squad 003 was digging the 'Spatial Balance Support Trough' as planned, and encountered an attack from the local forces, and has imprisoned the other party."</p><p></p><p>"Squad 012 ...... has encountered an attack by native forces and has scared off the other party."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief as she looked at the information that was passed back one by one.</p><p></p><p>With so many people from their Twin Sword Sect entering the Trial Star rashly, they would definitely be interfered with and attacked by the native forces of the Trial Star, something she had already anticipated in advance beforehand while also informing her master of the corresponding problems.</p><p></p><p>However, her master, Feng Cheng, gave feedback that most of those kings of the Trial Star were students of Master Yashan, and told them not to injure their lives, and if they interfered with the works, they could just be imprisoned directly.</p><p></p><p>This made Cong Shuling a little worried that there would be problems with the project, and now that she learned that everything was not too problematic, she let go of her heart.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The people of the Double Sword Sect had been hostile to each other because of the trials between them and the great villains of the various trial stars, and both sides wanted to get back at it and have a big fight when they met.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the Infinity Sect's people were much more peaceful.</p><p></p><p>When the Winged Man King Quan Fu Gui saw the Ghost Man King, he laughed out loud in surprise and said, "Classmate Yunhe, it's been a long time na, almost a thousand years! Can you still remember me?"</p><p></p><p>The ghost man king froze directly after seeing Quan Fugui, "You ...... are classmate Fugui?"</p><p></p><p>They were classmates who played better when they followed Yashan to study back then.</p><p></p><p>Winged man king Quan Fugui directly walked up and hooked the ghost man king's neck, flipped his hand and pulled out a few bottles of good wine, and walked to the side without saying anything: "Go go go, you my classmates meet again after many years, so rare, drink a cup together."</p><p></p><p>Finished turning his head toward his team roared: "Boys, I met my old classmates, go to drink two cups, you work nimbly, there are problems immediately find me, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Understood! Master!"</p><p></p><p>Three cups down, the two are more familiar with a lot, talk about the things of the year, really saddening, the same is a classmate, but the last road is completely different, a trapped in a planet, day song nothing to do, a random travel star sea, where can go, experience is unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Man King could only sigh helplessly whenever he thought of his lost opportunities, and finally couldn't help but ask, "What are you guys doing? Is this something arranged by the teacher?"</p><p></p><p>Winged Man King Quan Fu Gui nodded his head in a faintly unseen manner, and came close to the Ghost Man King and said quietly, "I'll tell you in secret, don't spread the word, not many people know about this project at the moment, and although Teacher said that when it's finished, he'll put out a notice to all the worlds, but after all, it isn't out yet isn't it."</p><p></p><p>Ghost Man King said, "Good brother, what kind of person am I that you still can't trust? Speak freely, there will not be a third person who knows."</p><p></p><p>Quan Fu Gui said, "Four words, world passage."</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Man King froze, unsure: "What world passage?"</p><p></p><p>Quan Fugui: "Come, come, drink! You'll know about this later, haha!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Ji Dingcheng's five people followed beside the Chipu Daemon King and asked curiously, "Big Brother Chipu, where are you taking us?"</p><p></p><p>The Chipu Great Demon King didn't look back and said, "Don't talk nonsense, just follow me, will I still trap you?"</p><p></p><p>Chipu Daemon King then secretly said, "Cong Shuling and the girls have been secretly tossing some things around for some time recently, but they didn't even tell me, it's too much, I'm definitely going to go and do some investigating today, to see what they're actually playing with."</p><p></p><p>The experience of working in a factory for many years had caused him to rise up with boredom towards that factory building, but he had never found the opportunity to tell his master that he didn't want to do it.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Ji Dingcheng's five and secretly surveyed them, "These five little guys that Master Teacher stuffed over are quite capable, why don't we just let them take over my position as factory manager!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he couldn't help but reveal an inexplicable smile before accessing the galactic network and looking it up in the galactic network.</p><p></p><p>"Found it!"</p><p></p><p>Soon he reopened his eyes and directly teleported away with the five people.</p><p></p><p>Then he quietly approached the construction site to look.</p><p></p><p>Being unsure, if anything, he turned his head to look in the other direction.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a dozen or so humans of various shapes and sizes coming this way, like a small tour group, curiously peering into the construction site.</p><p></p><p>The aura perceived from these dozen or so people aroused the vigilance of the Chip Daemon King.</p><p></p><p>"One, two, three ...... nineteen in total! How come it's similar to the feeling that Master and the others gave me?"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the eighteen deities who had met here to observe with their junior brother, Servant Cao, also saw the Chipu Great Demon King.</p><p></p><p>Both sides' gazes met in one place.</p>

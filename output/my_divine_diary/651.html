        <h1>Chapter 651</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Over so many years, Su Hao's consciousness power had been continuously elevating, growing from an ordinary human consciousness to one comparable to divine beings, gaining various extraordinary abilities.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not satisfied.</p><p></p><p>He believed that even having advanced to this level, he was still just an ordinary human after all!</p><p></p><p>"The essence of my consciousness has not changed."</p><p></p><p>Among these, 'spiritual power' was a key factor.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power, acting as the bridge connecting consciousness to the world, would be limited by the physical body itself, unable to grow continuously and without restriction.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Su Hao's spiritual power was constrained by the physical body, having an extreme limit.</p><p></p><p>Before breaking through this physical limitation, he would still only be an ordinary mortal.</p><p></p><p>However, for him to reach this limit now, there was still a long way to go.</p><p></p><p>At least for now, he still felt his spiritual power had great room for improvement, far from reaching the limit. It was just that limited by his knowledge, he did not know where to start.</p><p></p><p>The 'beyond divinity' he proposed was precisely to find a way to push his spiritual power to the current achievable limit.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, he should be able to sense the energy operation of the 'Doom System', right?</p><p></p><p>It might bring Su Hao a surprise, or perhaps provide a new perspective that would allow him to continue strengthening his 'spiritual power'!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Yuan Feng and Ling Xue sat back-to-back on the grass, looking up at the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ling Xue curiously asked, "Yuan Feng, why haven't I gotten pregnant yet? Is there something wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng was momentarily tongue-tied, looking embarrassed as he stammered, "This...it can't be, right? Everything's fine, how could there be a problem?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Xue looked sullen and depressed. Yuan Feng comforted her, "Could it be your problem?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the comforting words came out, Yuan Feng immediately realized his blunder.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Ling Xue instantly flew into a rage, turning around and grabbing Yuan Feng's waist, "I suspected there was something wrong with you, you should just admit it. How dare you turn around and suspect me instead?"</p><p></p><p>The two tussled for a while, then Yuan Feng proposed, "Master Fei Yao is so knowledgeable, he must know what the problem is. Should we go ask him?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Xue shook her head, "No, he's been holed up in the lab every day, very busy. We shouldn't disturb him."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng said, "That's true, but we often see Master Feng Cheng. Why don't we ask Master Feng Cheng? With his profound wisdom, he must understand this too."</p><p></p><p>Ling Xue hesitated for a moment before agreeing, "Okay, let's ask Master Feng Cheng."</p><p></p><p>When Feng Cheng was maintaining various machinery, Yuan Feng and Ling Xue came to find him.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng raised his eyebrows, "Infertility?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng and Ling Xue blushed deeply at Feng Cheng's words.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "You've come to the right person to ask about this, I do know a bit."</p><p></p><p>In order to freely indulge in all sorts of fancies in the Zouleyuan Palace, Feng Cheng had studied up on this area of knowledge, including how to avoid pregnancy.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng examined the two of them and immediately had a conclusion, "I've found the problem."</p><p></p><p>Ling Xue's first reaction was, "Whose problem is it?"</p><p></p><p>While Yuan Feng asked, "Is it curable?"</p><p></p><p>The two asked at the same time, then Ling Xue felt very embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed heartily, "You both have problems. And yes, it's curable. What do you say, should I treat you?"</p><p></p><p>"Please do!"</p><p></p><p>The two had been idling on the spaceship for years, bored out of their minds. They wanted to have a little child to liven things up and add some fun to their boring lives.</p><p></p><p>For Feng Cheng, the treatment was just a casual matter. However, since this involved the birth of a new life on the spaceship, he still needed to ask the great MasterWei first.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Feng Cheng sent Su Hao a message: "Great MasterWei, Yuan Feng and Ling Xue want to have a child, should I let them conceive smoothly?"</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Su Hao replied: "Let them. Let them have more!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng understood, telling Yuan Feng and Ling Xue: "Let me make some preparations first, I'll treat you in two days."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Feng Cheng."</p><p></p><p>After the two left, Feng Cheng continued maintaining the machinery, chuckling softly, "Master Wei said to have more, four or five in one pregnancy wouldn't be too much, right?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Ling Xue became pregnant.</p><p></p><p>Ten months later, she gave birth to five infants - two boys and three girls.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng was dumbstruck. Just what potent seed did he have that was like a shotgun blast, hitting five at once...?</p><p></p><p>The problem now was that the two of them couldn't handle taking care of so many!</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng held one child in each arm, while the other three rolled around crying loudly on the bed, their voices booming with vibrant energy.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng stepped down, and a set of cribs rose from the ground, transforming into five cribs. He gently picked up each child and placed them in the cribs, rocking them lightly. The children soon quieted down.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng looked at Feng Cheng with admiration, "As expected of Master Feng Cheng, knowledgeable about everything. Master, could you help name our children...?"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Yuan Feng immediately realized the problem, "Oh no, I've forgotten who's the eldest, who's the second..."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed heartily, "I've kept track for you."</p><p></p><p>Then with a wave of his hand, a silver ingot appeared and split into five portions, each transforming into a silver bangle.</p><p></p><p>"The eldest is named Ling Baihua, the second Yuan Xiafeng, the third Yuan Qiuye, the fourth Ling Tingxue, the fifth Ling Ling. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>The boys took Yuan Feng's surname, while the girls took Ling Xue's.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng murmured, "Spring, summer, autumn, winter...there is no spring, summer, autumn, or winter on this spaceship, is it to use their names to commemorate the seasons?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Xue, lying on the bed, also smiled, "Very nice names."</p><p></p><p>She had just given birth, and although treated by Feng Cheng, still appeared somewhat weak.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled faintly, "Who says there's no spring, summer, autumn, and winter on this spaceship? Not only that, but also high mountains, lakes, rivers, oceans, forests - whatever you want, it's all here."</p><p></p><p>The two were astonished.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng put the bangles engraved with their respective names on each of the five children, then said, "We all have our own matters to attend to and can't help you take care of the children. You two will just have to work hard and find a way yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Their food, clothing and living needs would all be taken care of automatically by the machines, so the two of them could easily handle taking care of five children.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng scratched his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng added, "Of course, if you have any issues, you can come find me. Just call my name to the sky."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng was overjoyed, "Thank you, Master Feng Cheng!"</p><p></p><p>After Feng Cheng left, Yuan Feng looked at his five children, still feeling like he was in a dream.</p><p></p><p>"I've become a father so quickly? And the father of five children at that...without any preparation at all. Who can tell me what I should do..."</p><p></p><p>Weak, helpless, pitiful...</p><p></p><p>Not long after Feng Cheng left, the five children started crying again, and Yuan Feng was flustered.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "I regret it now...when I didn't have children I was free and unrestrained. Why did I have such a lapse in judgment and actually want to have children!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng merrily sent Su Hao a message: "Great MasterWei, Ling Xue gave birth to five healthy children all at once."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao replied, "That was pretty fast!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan commented, "I didn't expect you to be such a skilled obstetrician, Feng Cheng. Impressive, impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng took it as Ya Shan praising him and chuckled, "If not for considering the nutritional issues, I could have given her ten at once."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Five is enough for now. Don't fill the entire spaceship with children."</p><p></p><p>Imagining the whole ship filled with noisy children running around, Feng Cheng shuddered, "Understood! With me here, they won't be able to have another one from now on."</p><p></p><p>In Lab No. 1, Fei Yao also sensed the five new lives and curiously asked Su Hao, "Mr. Jia Wei, do you approve of them reproducing offspring here?"</p><p></p><p>A male and a female could theoretically reproduce an entire tribe.</p><p></p><p>Inbreeding would increase the probability of genetic diseases, but that was just statistical probability. As long as they kept reproducing and screening out defective individuals while expanding the population base, a stable tribe could perhaps quickly form...</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just theoretical, since no world had ever truly been left with only one male and one female.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Source Star, that is...</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao would not let them reproduce indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>"This spaceship is our vehicle for exploring the universe, not a haven for the Source Star humans. I cannot allow them to keep reproducing here indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>However, if Yuan Feng and Ling Xue intend to single-handedly save the Source Star humans, in twenty years' time when the situation on the Source Star has stabilized a bit, we could consider helping them establish a human settlement there and let them reproduce naturally on the Source Star.</p><p></p><p>Whether they succeed or not depends on fate and their own efforts."</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao shook his head, "How difficult that would be."</p><p></p><p>Without a complete ecosystem, it would basically be impossible for humans alone to reproduce and survive.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao changed the subject, "You had some ideas about spiritual power that you couldn't verify, right? You can take those five children as students and teach them knowledge, while also observing whether your ideas are feasible."</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao said, "Very well, Mr. Jia Wei. After these children turn six, I will be their teacher."</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then asked, "By the way, Mr. Jia Wei, are there any restrictions on the knowledge I can impart?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "No restrictions, teach however you think is best."</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao let out a long breath, "Mr. Jia Wei, you are truly generous to impart such precious knowledge without any reservations."</p><p></p><p>In Fei Yao's view, this was the conduct of a sage.</p><p></p><p>Even he himself would not dare to say he was willing to transmit his knowledge to others without any reservations, right?</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the generous patron for the large donation! I'm unable to add extra chapters for now, but will make it up later!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 787</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Suhao's actions actually made the operations of Yahan and Fengcheng somewhat smoother.</p><p></p><p>After learning that Xu Shiqiang had returned this time but was still only interested in technology and dared not show interest in their rights, the four major human alliances were greatly relieved and willingly agreed to transfer their high-end technologies to them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before the technology transfer, they repeatedly confirmed one thing: not only could their forces not defeat 'Jia Yahan' and 'Jia Fengcheng', they couldn't even escape them.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't win or escape, whether the three human sacred ones were truly sacred or not became irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>Because Jia Yahan clearly stated that the high-end technologies of the four major alliances in the Cloud Ring System were actually quite similar. They didn't need all the alliances to hand over their technologies; as long as one side was willing to hand them over, it would achieve their purpose.</p><p></p><p>As for the alliances unwilling to hand over their technologies, they would be directly eliminated, while also demonstrating their strength to the other three sides, serving as a warning.</p><p></p><p>Simple, crude, and effective!</p><p></p><p>After all, they had detailed records of how the three human sacred ones had previously annihilated the Eight-Armed Race.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the three human sacred ones, being human themselves, would commit such massacres against their own kind...</p><p></p><p>No one would think about that, as they themselves were experts at slaughtering their own kind. On the battlefield against opposing alliances, it was a matter of your death or mine.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the fourth generation Celestial Emperor, who was suspected of being captured by the sacred one Xu Shiqiang, actually returned.</p><p></p><p>And he publicly declared that the person who took him away was indeed Xu Shiqiang, the leader of the three human sacred ones. This time, he was only taken away to discuss some cultivation issues. The previous battle occurred due to a misunderstanding when the situation was unclear...</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>With this authoritative public statement, the nature of this incident was basically settled, causing an uproar in human society.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my god, unbelievable, too unbelievable! The human sacred one Xu Shiqiang is actually still alive and has reappeared."</p><p></p><p>"The greatest human sacred one Xu Shiqiang has returned? If I'm not mistaken, he should be from over six thousand years ago. Six thousand years, hmm...let me think about what six thousand years means. Oh no, I have no concept of six thousand years, I can't figure it out!"</p><p></p><p>"Can someone come out and refute this? I feel like this ending is not what I imagined. At first I thought someone was just hyping it up, wondering who would dare impersonate the sacred one Xu Shiqiang. The story development was so unexpected."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Shiqiang is confirmed, the Celestial Emperor personally authenticated it, it can't be fake. No wonder the Celestial Emperor had no ability to resist and was just taken away - it was actually the real sacred one Xu Shiqiang, it all makes sense."  </p><p></p><p>"Ah! The sacred one Xu Shiqiang is so handsome, I wish he would take me away too. Does anyone know how to get taken away by him?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if the sacred one Xu Shiqiang needs another..."</p><p></p><p>"@XXX @Invincible Golden Flower @I am Xu Shiqiang @Hao the Dog @...You people come out and accept death. I remember you all said the three sacred ones didn't deserve the title of sacred one, and slandered the three sacred ones. Now that the real sacred one has appeared, dare you confront him?"</p><p></p><p>"Those people actually deactivated their accounts! Luckily I have screenshots, so I can find them. Where are the cyber bullies? Quickly lock onto those who spoke recklessly online and give them due punishment. Better to hang them all."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The outside clamor did not affect Suhao at all. He easily obtained what he wanted, and had no further major interest in other matters of the Cloud Ring System.</p><p></p><p>What Suhao needed to do next was simple: digest all the technologies he had collected.</p><p></p><p>Digesting them required three steps. First, read through and understand the principles of each technology. Second, enter human laboratories to verify and practice the technologies. Third, use the acquired technologies to optimize his current strength system.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Suhao only wanted human high-tech, but after returning he found that the techniques related to spiritual power transformation given by the immortal cultivation realm were most useful to him.</p><p></p><p>This series of spiritual power techniques directly allowed Suhao's long-stagnant strength to be greatly enhanced once again.</p><p></p><p>The 'spiritual' structure invented by the fourth generation Celestial Emperor used spiritual power as a single core unit, skillfully constructing an outer layer around it with 'spiritual air' to form a spiritual power unit containing more energy, greater compatibility, and richer functions.</p><p></p><p>Its comprehensive performance was nearly twice as strong as the spiritual power he had been using.</p><p></p><p>In other words, all of his abilities that relied on activating spiritual power would experience tremendous growth.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the power naturally developed by civilization. As long as the base was large enough, the development direction would be diverse enough that low-probability metamorphic events would become highly probable.</p><p></p><p>Suhao admitted that even if given ten thousand years, he might not be able to develop this 'spiritual' structure himself.</p><p></p><p>Because it had nothing to do with intelligence; no matter how high his brain's intelligence, he could not deduce all the development trends and laws of the world.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, no one could do that.</p><p></p><p>Fifty years later, Suhao had basically digested all the technologies.</p><p></p><p>The various technologies developed by humans over more than six thousand years, Suhao only needed fifty years to digest and absorb the useful parts to upgrade himself.</p><p></p><p>The asymmetry was striking.</p><p></p><p>But that was the reality - exploring the unknown was extremely difficult, while learning from the paths of later generations was much easier.</p><p></p><p>After digesting the technologies, Suhao raised the strength of his main body and the Eight-Armed God avatar to higher levels.</p><p></p><p>The structure of the Eight-Armed God was also vastly different from the beginning. Previously, it constructed a spiritual power grid inside the body, but now the 'spiritual' elements almost fused with the flesh and blood, with no obvious grid traces remaining inside.</p><p></p><p>It was like the 'immortal body' tempered by the body refining techniques of immortal cultivation myths!</p><p></p><p>Six years later, Suhao emerged from the starlight roaming state and continued forward.</p><p></p><p>Ten years after that, Suhao could finally no longer withstand the current environment and was forced to stop, while the 'spiritual' elements inside him operated at maximum power to resist the particle bombardment from the black hole's jets.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, his body armor formations shifted, switching to a gravity formation and transforming into a large light sphere that then connected to the planetary network.</p><p></p><p>Numerous smaller consciousnesses scattered out in all directions, instantly reaching the edge of the interstellar network and gazing outward.</p><p></p><p>"I can now simultaneously access eight external galaxies, with the farthest galaxy 1.8 million light-years away from the Cloud Ring System!"</p><p></p><p>A surge of pleasant surprise flooded Suhao's heart.</p><p></p><p>He had become even stronger!</p><p></p><p>1.8 million light-years, such an immense distance...</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself: "In the future, I'll be able to transmit to even farther locations, like a true deity overlooking the vast galaxies of the universe."</p><p></p><p>He chose the farthest planet accessible in the planetary network, then transmitted there.</p><p></p><p>Standing on a black rock, Suhao looked at his hands and murmured: "Even if I truly achieve this, it still feels inconceivable to me. The universe is such a wondrous existence..."</p><p></p><p>After a while, he returned to the second-level world, then entered the billiard space.</p><p></p><p>It was the same old study, with the familiar pen and paper.</p><p></p><p>He sat properly at the desk, seriously considering how to plan the remaining less than two thousand years of his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>He wrote on the paper:</p><p></p><p>"First, the problem of eternal life;</p><p></p><p>That is, as long as I can synchronize my consciousness to the spiritual power brain, I can rely on the spiritual power brain to gain eternal thinking ability, equivalent to eternal life."</p><p></p><p>Eternal life would allow Suhao to explore the unknown without restraint, to fully grasp everything without worrying about accidents after falling asleep.</p><p></p><p>He could even use his long life to overlook a civilization, watching it be born, develop, grow, decline, and perish...</p><p></p><p>He could freely create his ideal life forms and release them onto habitable planets to observe their evolution.</p><p></p><p>He could fearlessly watch time pass by.</p><p></p><p>Just feeling the passage of time, perhaps that was a pleasure too - the pleasure of the eternal.</p><p></p><p>Suhao continued writing: "Second, a stronger formation to withstand the particle jets when black holes devour matter;</p><p></p><p>The closer I get to a black hole, the wider my view, but no view is wide enough for the infinite universe.</p><p></p><p>Third, research stronger 'gravity formations' to combine with black holes for wider views and interstellar network transmission.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, wavefronts..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Suhao shook his head and crossed out the fourth line.</p><p></p><p>Even until now, he could only see wavefronts, evade wavefronts, but still could not find a way to resolve them.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps his current level was still insufficient, unable to find that critical point to master wavefronts.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need much, just one critical point would be enough.</p><p></p><p>But who could tell him where the critical point about wavefronts was?</p>

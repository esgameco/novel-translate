        <h1>Chapter 925</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The five travelers from the same squad successfully seized the crystal, and upon choosing to return, this time they did not arrive in that familiar small space. Instead, they came to a floating bluestone platform, surrounded by a breathtakingly beautiful mountain valley that looked like a secluded immortal's dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this? Have we successfully met all the requirements?"</p><p></p><p>"It should be so. We just need to wait to know the result. The doubts that have lingered for so long may be revealed today. However, we cannot be too careless."</p><p></p><p>"Whew...after fifteen years, we have finally passed the test and reached the end. It's a pity that many of our teammates can't return."</p><p></p><p>Upon mentioning their teammates, the five's excited mood immediately dampened, becoming somewhat somber.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a circle of rune patterns lit up on the bluestone slab nearby. With a flash of light, a smiling young lady in a blue dress walked over, her voice ringing like silver bells, "Congratulations, trial participants, on successfully completing the first stage of the trial and surviving in the end. Allow me to introduce myself, I am Ren Wenlan, a fifth generation disciple of the Twin Blades Sect. For the time being, I will guide you in your life in the Twin Blades City."</p><p></p><p>A strong young man stepped forward, bowed and said, "Greetings, Miss Ren. I am Ji Dingcheng, the captain of this squad. May I ask what is this Twin Blades City, what is the Twin Blades Sect, and we..."</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan smiled, "I know you have many doubts, but do not be impatient. You will soon understand everything. You will also understand how fortunate it is to be standing here alive. The world before you will exceed your imagination.</p><p></p><p>Follow me, and I'll explain as we go."</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan made a hand seal, and light shone from beneath her feet again. The complex patterns expanded outward, and with a brilliant flash, everyone disappeared and arrived inside an immense palace.</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan led them out of the palace to see a cluster of palaces surrounded by mountains.</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan said, "This cluster of palaces was built by disciples of the Twin Blades Sect according to their personal preferences. If you five are fortunate enough to join the Twin Blades Sect, you will also have the opportunity to find an auspicious location here and build your own palace. It is an honor."</p><p></p><p>Ji Dingcheng curiously asked, "Is this all the territory of the Twin Blades Sect? Do all trial participants who complete the trial eventually come here?"</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan couldn't help but laugh heartily, "The territory of the Twin Blades Sect? That's the best joke I've heard all year."</p><p></p><p>She pointed to the sky, "The Twin Blades Sect has no territory, because everything you see, including this universe and the stars above, almost everything you know, belongs to the Twin Blades Sect. Do you understand what I mean?"</p><p></p><p>The five were shaken, a sense of disbelief welling up. Ji Dingcheng quickly caught the key word and asked doubtfully, "You said 'almost', which means some parts don't belong to the Twin Blades Sect. What are those?"</p><p></p><p>For Ji Dingcheng, understanding the Twin Blades Sect's adversaries was part of understanding the sect itself.</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan smiled, "Besides the Twin Blades Sect, there are the Reincarnation Sect and the Infinite Sect. And these three sects belong to the same family, so theoretically, the entire universe belongs to the three sects. Of course, I know you won't understand what I'm saying, because without truly understanding the Twin Blades Sect, there's no way to comprehend the greatness of the three sects, nor will you understand what we will do next."</p><p></p><p>Ji Dingcheng curiously asked, "What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan pointed above, "What we must ultimately do is very simple - to go to the distant depths of the universe and seek the priceless treasures born from the universe itself. It's too early to tell you this. You don't have that qualification yet. After you successfully become disciples, your masters will tell you the true mission of my Twin Blades Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Become disciples?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, become disciples! Every few years, the senior members of the Twin Blades Sect who have reached a certain level will come to the Twin Blades City to publicly accept disciples. If any senior takes a liking to you, you can smoothly join the Twin Blades Sect and follow your master to learn. From then on, you can call yourselves members of the Twin Blades Sect.</p><p></p><p>Of course, sometimes the great founder of the Twin Blades Sect, the Celestial Feng Cheng, may also come to the Twin Blades City on a whim to accept disciples. But only those with great destiny can meet the Celestial Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>It has been twenty years since I joined the Twin Blades Sect. In these twenty years, only two lucky ones have been accepted as direct disciples by the Celestial Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the Celestial Feng Cheng happened to come to the Twin Blades City in a good mood and met two who had just completed the trial. He casually asked, 'You two have just finished the trial, right? Would you like to become my disciples?' Those two lucky ones then became our master's grand-disciples just like that...</p><p></p><p>How enviable!"</p><p></p><p>These words made the five's hearts waver, harboring the thought that perhaps they too would encounter the Celestial Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a handsome young man in a blue shirt with short hair suddenly appeared before them, beaming, "Oh? Judging by your disheveled appearances, you've just completed the trial, right? Would you like to become my disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Including Ren Wenlan, all six were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan's eyes widened in disbelief, "The Celestial... Feng Cheng?"</p><p></p><p>She immediately reacted, bowing to Feng Cheng, "Greetings, Master Founder."</p><p></p><p>Ji Dingcheng quickly reacted, kneeling to kowtow, "Greetings, Master. This disciple is willing."</p><p></p><p>The other four followed suit, "Greetings, Master. This disciple is willing."</p><p></p><p>As for whether it was a trick... so be it if they were deceived!</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed heartily, "What a coincidence! I had just thought of taking in disciples, and here I stumble upon you all. Alright! You wait here for a few days first, follow Wenlan to get familiar with the environment. I'll come find you later. I'll go take a look around first."</p><p></p><p>With that, Feng Cheng flashed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan was immediately enveloped by a sense of bliss, murmuring dazedly, "The Celestial Feng Cheng... he called my name, he called me 'Wenlan'. Ah, such sudden happiness."</p><p></p><p>Ji Dingcheng and the other five had flashes of Feng Cheng's towering figure in their minds, whispering, "Was that just now the universe's controller, the founder of the Twin Blades Sect - the Celestial Feng Cheng? We've just become disciples of the Celestial Feng Cheng? It feels like a dream."</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan came to her senses and looked at Ji Dingcheng and the other five, suddenly feeling a strange sensation.</p><p></p><p>These five, originally supposed to be juniors and trial participants, had in the blink of an eye become her master's grand-disciples?</p><p></p><p>Ji Dingcheng seemed to sense Ren Wenlan's predicament and immediately smiled, "Miss Ren need not mind. We have not officially joined the Celestial's sect, so you can treat us as ordinary trial participants."</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan breathed a sigh of relief and revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>But when facing the five again, she couldn't help feeling differently than before, subconsciously showing them more respect.</p><p></p><p>Ren Wenlan thought to herself, "Luck is also a kind of strength. When I completed the trial, I didn't encounter the Celestial Feng Cheng, so it can only be said that my strength in luck was insufficient..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not only did Feng Cheng take in disciples on a whim, Yashanlso made a special trip to the Transformation Planet, taking away a batch of dimensional travelers he had personally sent there and accepting them as students for concentrated study before selecting suitable disciples.</p><p></p><p>Yashan's disciples were distinctly different from Feng Cheng's.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng's disciples were superior trial participants screened by the 'First Primordial God', all with meticulous thoughts, agile bodies, and keen danger perception.</p><p></p><p>Yashan's disciples, on the other hand, were directly thrown into a nearly primitive harsh environment to fend for themselves, eventually growing into kings of a planet - each domineering and indomitable, with unyielding will, yet also highly versatile.</p><p></p><p>Both had their strengths.</p><p></p><p>Fittingly, both Yashan and Feng Cheng were very satisfied with the temperaments of their respective disciples.</p><p></p><p>Yashan favored the bold and domineering, while Feng Cheng preferred the clever and nimble-minded.</p><p></p><p>Teaching them was also very enjoyable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when they encountered disciples who couldn't learn, both would lose their tempers.</p>

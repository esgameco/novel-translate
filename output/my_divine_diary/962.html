        <h1>Chapter 962</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Feng Cheng, Chipu has discovered a special planet. There is a life form here with very unique genes. You can come take a look, it may give you some new inspiration for your 'gene power'."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said in surprise, "Chipu discovered a new planet? How come he didn't tell me about it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "I discovered it by chance. I found these demon insects interesting, so I came to check it out."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Have you completed your main research project, Master Wei?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Mainly on the research of luck lines. After years of attempts, I've found a general model. However, I can only control the good or bad of 'luck' in a broad direction, not precisely control the level of luck. More time is needed.</p><p></p><p>However, there has been smooth progress on the 'Avoiding Calamity Technique'. I can now construct an avoiding calamity model with my soul power. As long as I build a specific structure on the soul using this technique, it can achieve the same effect as a 'lucky coin'.</p><p></p><p>The key is that it's very convenient, no need to carry a coin. But this 'Avoiding Calamity Technique' is not easy to learn."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng praised, "Impressive. After all these years, my gene power has not made much progress. It seems implanting 'power' into the human primitive genes, then locking the power layer by layer, is not going to work."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Your solution has arrived then? Perhaps these newly discovered demon insects can solve your problem."</p><p></p><p>After participating in the demon insect research, Feng Cheng said in amazement, "The metamorphic development of these demon insects is truly incredible! They can become any form through multiple metamorphoses and gene fusion. Even an abnormally complex intelligent brain can be developed. Unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Strictly speaking, the first two are fixed metamorphic developments - from worms to frog-like creatures, then to giant beetles.</p><p></p><p>The last is a fusion metamorphic development. The giant beetles, after devouring different creatures and ingesting their flesh and genes, will metamorphose towards that species.</p><p></p><p>But it's an incomplete metamorphosis. They can keep adjusting their current body by consuming more flesh, until they reach what they consider the perfect state."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "It seems similar to our Xiren sequence evolution."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "There are some similarities, but essentially different. The Xiren gene sequence inserts a unique gene segment at specific locations without affecting the human core genes, to activate different special abilities.</p><p></p><p>But the demon insect genes are not like that. They have extremely powerful compatibility. Let me put it this way - even if we randomly mess up their genes beyond recognition, these demon insects can still live well, and then develop forms based on the messed up genes."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng stroked his chin, "So if I randomly mess with their genes, they can randomly develop forms matching the genes, but their bodies won't collapse. Just thinking about it seems unbelievable. This ability is almost defying heaven."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "If the demon insects had enough intelligence and knowledge, it would indeed be so. That's why these demon insects are so extraordinarily special. At the gene level, it seems no matter how you mess with them, there won't be any problems. They are the best experimental subjects.</p><p></p><p>Their life essence is much stronger than humans. Our 'Residual Toxin' gene toxin is invincible against other life forms, but has no effect on them."</p><p></p><p>The appearance of these demon insects has violated their common genetic knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng frowned, "That shouldn't be the case. Once genes have problems, all the proteins must be in chaos, and the body will quickly collapse and die..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "That's why I said, the value these demon insects bring us is not in their genes, but in their cells. I think the reason they can maintain their bodies is in their cells.</p><p></p><p>If we can truly decipher it, your envisioned gene power and gene locks may have a breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng sighed, "Indeed, as Master Wei said, other hills can be used to attack jade.</p><p></p><p>Being confined in a small area and pondering alone makes it very difficult to have major breakthroughs. Going out to learn more diverse knowledge is more likely to solve current problems.</p><p></p><p>The gene power I've researched for thousands of years may not be as good as Chipu's small discovery."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head, "It's not absolute. Without your thousands of years of accumulation, even if this insect was placed in front of you, you wouldn't know where to start. Accumulation, discovery, innovation - none can be missed.</p><p></p><p>This is also why I created the Great World, because the fusion and collision of races can deepen our current knowledge foundation.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when encountering new life planets and new knowledge, we may be able to apply some of our discoveries.</p><p></p><p>So exploration and self-research accumulation promote each other."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't just say this for Feng Cheng, but also for himself. After saying it, he smiled, "Since you're so interested in these demon insects, you can be my assistant and research them together here!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded, "Good, Master Wei, that's what I was thinking too."</p><p></p><p>However, before officially starting the research, Feng Cheng had something to take care of first.</p><p></p><p>After explaining to Su Hao, he flashed into the demon city built by Chipu the Great Demon King. At this time, the demon city was filled with singing and dancing, with all kinds of races gathered, drinking and being merry.</p><p></p><p>It was truly a scene of demonic revelry.</p><p></p><p>When Feng Cheng appeared, the entire demon city quickly fell silent, and the demon kings looked at the young man who suddenly appeared in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The most astonished was none other than Chipu the Great Demon King. When he saw Feng Cheng, he was dumbstruck, opening his mouth to call out, "Master!"</p><p></p><p>Chipu the Great Demon King's mind raced, thinking about his current situation. He immediately realized that the planet he planned to secretly hide had been discovered by his master.</p><p></p><p>His first reaction was 'there's a mole'.</p><p></p><p>But at this point, he couldn't care about much else. He immediately rushed up to Feng Cheng, paid his respects and said, "Greetings, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Then he turned and shouted at the crowd, "Why aren't you greeting the Immortal Lord?"</p><p></p><p>The demon kings immediately followed Chipu the Great Demon King's example and bowed, "Greetings, Immortal Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled, "You all seem quite lively here. How come you didn't invite me to this banquet?"</p><p></p><p>What made Feng Cheng most unsatisfied was that this planet was discovered by his disciple Chipu, but he only found out about it from Master Wei instead.</p><p></p><p>This order of knowing made him feel uncomfortable. As Master Wei's assistant, the proper way should have been for him to summarize the useful information discovered by the Twin Sword Sect and report it to Master Wei.</p><p></p><p>The current situation clearly showed that he, the founder of the Twin Sword Sect, had been derelict in his duty.</p><p></p><p>Although Master Wei might not care about this, Feng Cheng took it very seriously. If Elder Yashan found out about this, he would definitely mock Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>As Master Wei's assistants, it was not enough for them to just talk about it verbally - they had to actually do their jobs properly.</p><p></p><p>Chipu the Great Demon King showed a silly grin, "It's because you were busy with more important matters, Master. I thought about it, if I disturbed your important business, that would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, you don't enjoy these kinds of activities, so in the end I decided not to invite you."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng didn't care what he said and telepathically instructed Chipu, "Chipu, communicate with me more about anything that happens from now on, understand? If there's a next time, you won't need this Demon Realm anymore, you can go back to working in the factory."</p><p></p><p>Chipu the Great Demon King immediately said, "Understood, Master!"</p><p></p><p>After Feng Cheng left, the group of demon kings in the city finally let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the pressure Feng Cheng exerted on everyone was too great, as if their lives were at his whim.</p><p></p><p>Chipu the Great Demon King looked very regretful, having lost interest in continuing to host the banquet. With a wave of his hand, he dismissed everyone.</p><p></p><p>He was very puzzled about how his master found out about this world, as he thought he had hidden it very well...</p><p></p><p>"I can't play tricks on the masters anymore~"</p>

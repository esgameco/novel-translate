        <h1>Chapter 592</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang's faces looked a bit more mature. Although their beards were cleanly shaven, one could still see that their jaws had become more robust.</p><p></p><p>Their hairstyles had caught up with Suhao and the others, turning into crew cuts. </p><p></p><p>This was Axing's idea - he suddenly wanted to do it this way, so he just did it.</p><p></p><p>What left Awang feeling helpless was that after Axing cut his own hair, he insisted on forcing Awang to also get a crew cut.</p><p></p><p>Now the five young men with crew cuts sat together at a table in the tavern, forming a dashing scenery that caught the frequent sidelong glances of various drinking girls and ladies.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they sat down, Fengcheng couldn't wait to ask, "Axing, Awang, have you found girlfriends yet?"</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang's expressions stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Then Axing nonchalantly reached out to ruffle his short hair and said, "There are too many, I don't know which one to choose."</p><p></p><p>Awang also snickered, "That's right! The people pursuing me now line up all the way to the next town. To find a girlfriend is just a matter of crooking my finger."</p><p></p><p>Yashan smirked, "That means you don't have one! You guys are so pathetic. If it were me, I'd have over a dozen kids running around already."</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang scoffed, "How come we don't see your kids running around?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled as if recalling his past kids, "Well, there's no mission from the boss right now."</p><p></p><p>He turned to Fengcheng, "Fengcheng, you haven't had a girlfriend before, right? Why don't you find a girl to marry and experience it?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng's face suddenly flushed red, "Oh...okay?"</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang's eyes lit up. Awang snickered, "Afeng, why don't we take you to a good place tonight?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng curiously asked, "What kind of place?"</p><p></p><p>Awang smiled mysteriously, "Just come with us, you won't be disappointed."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng looked towards Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed, "Go if you want to!"</p><p></p><p>Among those present, Fengcheng was the only one who hadn't experienced it.</p><p></p><p>A celestial cultivator probably didn't need this anymore, right? But who knows! Maybe Fengcheng just wanted to try it out of pure curiosity...</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Once the topic of pretty girls came up, the sense of unfamiliarity from not seeing each other for a long time immediately disappeared among the five of them.</p><p></p><p>Towards the end of the gathering, Axing suddenly said, "Ayang, do you know about the big recent event?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "You mean the fall of the royal families?"</p><p></p><p>Axing nodded, "That's right..."</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang had known early on that Suhao was related to the 'Earth-Scraping Armor', and even guessed that Suhao was the 'Earth-Scraping Armor' himself, after all they had seen Suhao's 'fate child' form.</p><p></p><p>Later, an organization dedicated to the royal families called the Glorious Society suddenly appeared. As they received more and more information, they suspected that Suhao and the others were part of the Glorious Society.</p><p></p><p>Up until today, they no longer had doubts, but were absolutely certain that Suhao and the others must be involved with the Glorious Society.</p><p></p><p>Axing hesitated, "Ayang, word is the Eighteen Empire Alliance has formed an army of 100,000 mages to eliminate the Glorious Society. You must know about this, right?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Of course, I heard they plan to dismantle the Glorious Society within three days! Seems quite formidable."</p><p></p><p>Axing glanced at Awang, not knowing how to continue, feeling that Ayang didn't seem too concerned about this matter.</p><p></p><p>He frowned in thought and said, "The mages forming the allied forces are all high-level source mages bought by the royal families. Rumor is they were meant to be the royal families' weapons against the 'reformists'. They're all quite famous..."</p><p></p><p>"Recently, Awang and I have been frequently invited to attend mage gatherings in Yixuan City. We've learned quite a bit. There are loud calls within the Mage Association to repeal the last clause of the Accord. Everyone is thinking of how to seize this opportunity to change that clause.</p><p></p><p>It's clear that many have serious doubts about that clause. But those voices have been suppressed by those in power.</p><p></p><p>According to them, we can't be certain what a world without royal rule would be like. It might become even worse! No one is willing to take that first step, as mishandling it could potentially trigger a new war and plunge the world into chaos.</p><p></p><p>My personal opinion is to support the Mage Association in revoking the protection for the royal families and letting them develop independently. Although I don't fully understand the reasoning, I feel that without the corruption of the royal families, this world might become better.</p><p></p><p>So, if the Glorious Society can withstand the assault from the Eighteen Empire Alliance's forces, Awang and I will go to Yixuan City and join the 'reformists' to work towards repealing the last clause of the Accord.</p><p></p><p>Ayang, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "If you're asking for my opinion, I can only share my view. To me, these matters cannot be judged as good or bad, right or wrong.</p><p></p><p>I'll just do whatever I think in my heart.</p><p></p><p>Axing, that clause is not actually important, nor are the royal families. What's important is what you want.</p><p></p><p>Do whatever makes you feel satisfied and fulfilled! Too many hesitations and doubts will only waste your time and life without accomplishing anything.</p><p></p><p>You should do things that you won't regret when you grow old and die."</p><p></p><p>Suhao has always been such a casual person. He has experienced a long period of time and seen many people go through the cycle of 'birth, aging, sickness and death'. After death, everything dissipates like smoke. If one cannot do what makes them happy while alive, then this short life will truly be full of regrets.</p><p></p><p>He has seen too many regrets.</p><p></p><p>Suhao added, "Axing, let me give you one more piece of information - the Glorious Society will not lose."</p><p></p><p>Axing fell silent, having made up his mind, "Let's just do it! If there's danger, I can always ask Ayang for help."</p><p></p><p>He had already earned the reputation of 'Bane of Bizarre Disasters', but Axing realized that running around eliminating various disasters did not actually improve the lives of ordinary people, only allowing those royal families who controlled most of society's resources to live better.</p><p></p><p>When he initially saw the atrocities of the royal families exposed by the Glorious Society, he was shaken. He had never imagined that the highly esteemed royal families were actually demonic beings.</p><p></p><p>He felt he should do something about this.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After the gathering ended and they were parting ways, Awang mischievously hooked his arm around Fengcheng's neck, ready to take him to a good place.</p><p></p><p>Axing extended an invitation to Suhao and Yashan.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "My youthful stirrings began and ended a long time ago."</p><p></p><p>As for Yashan, he confidently said, "If I meet a girl I like, I'll pursue her myself."</p><p></p><p>However, Yashan felt more drawn to the charming Zhu Huoren. To him, modern humans seemed to be lacking something.</p><p></p><p>Suhao and Yashan left, while Fengcheng followed Axing and Awang into the night in the big city.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely nervous, even able to hear his heart pounding in his chest like a drum.</p><p></p><p>As a celestial cultivator, it would be easy for him to calm himself. But tonight, he just wanted to be an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Not that his desires were particularly strong, he was just unable to resist his curiosity!</p><p></p><p>The night quietly passed.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, he swiftly returned to the base small world, busying himself with full vigor. But in the evenings, he would sneak off to find Axing and Awang again.</p><p></p><p>"Axing, Awang, take me again! I like the big round ones."</p><p></p><p>Awang snickered.</p><p></p><p>Axing waved his hand, "Sure, let's go! Still not enough for you? We'll go somewhere else tonight."</p><p></p><p>Fifteen days later, Fengcheng found the somewhat fatigued Axing and Awang again.</p><p></p><p>Awang could no longer laugh, weakly waving his hand, "Ah Feng, I can't take it anymore, I'm not going. Just call Axing!"</p><p></p><p>Axing also shook his head, "No no no, I'm not going either, you go by yourself!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng wondered, "What's wrong with you two? Out of money? No problem, I have plenty here."</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang: "......"</p><p></p><p>After another half month, Fengcheng suddenly felt a sense of listlessness. He learned to calm his mind and reflect on life. When reading philosophical books again, his realm unexpectedly advanced by a huge level.</p><p></p><p>However, he would still occasionally go out for a stroll.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>It was around this time that the allied forces of 100,000 mages from the Eighteen Empires launched their attack on the Glorious Society.</p><p></p><p>The Glorious Society was apprehensive, but as Zhipeng's friends, they had to stand up for their friend no matter what, even if it was dangerous. They could not abandon a friend.</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng himself was also uneasy, but fortunately he was not a coward afraid of death. Following Yashan's instructions, he managed the Glorious Society in an orderly manner. Even with the great army at their doorstep, they simply remained vigilant while carrying on as usual.</p><p></p><p>This trust was built when they succeeded in completely eliminating the royal families across the entire Hengxuan region some time ago.</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng could never have imagined how Jiawai and the other three alone managed to take down the palaces of the three largest cities in the Hengxuan region.</p><p></p><p>It was only after receiving definitive battle reports that he had no more doubts about the immense power of Jiawai and the other three.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Jiawai and his three brothers must be the strongest people in this world! With them around, everything will surely be no problem!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he lowered his head to read his book again, titled 'Politics and Philosophy'. His brow gradually furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Ah~ it's still so difficult!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 845</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>While Su Hao was deeply discussing various soul art structures with the five dragon gods, he sensed fluctuations coming from the locator stone's spiritual tentacles.</p><p></p><p>"It's Shaduo's mother's locator stone. Has she run into trouble again? What trouble could there be in the small world den?" </p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't hesitate and immediately controlled another young dragon avatar to teleport over.</p><p></p><p>After appearing, he scanned the area with his divine sense and found this was the small world den he had prepared for the dragon mother Shaduo. There were no other enemies around.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask in puzzlement, "Mother Shaduo, what did you need me for?"</p><p></p><p>After seeing Su Hao, the dragon mother Shaduo seemed to stop agonizing and simply stated the current situation to Su Hao, then said, "Lei'an, my child, what you don't know is that the ancestral lands have always been the breeding grounds for our giant dragon race since ancient times. But now the humans are invading, and our giant dragon race has organized a huge force to meet and resist them. However, without the support of the divine lords and dragon masters, this is simply an unequal war.</p><p></p><p>It can be foreseen that before long, the dragon forces that went to resist will be cruelly slaughtered by the humans, and the ancestral lands will become a human paradise. Perhaps some giant dragons will survive by chance, but there will be no place left in this world for the giant dragons to exist.</p><p></p><p>It is said that long ago, our dragon race did not only have gold and black dragons, but also azure and red dragons. However, these two dragon species, without the protection of divine beings, have already completely disappeared from history.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that our remaining gold and black dragon races are about to become history as well...</p><p></p><p>Although I am just an ordinary dragon mother, as a member of the gold dragon race, I do not want to see our race become extinct!"</p><p></p><p>She sighed deeply, "Lei'an, my child, I don't know if you can understand what I'm saying, but I hope you can bring the divine lords back and have them drive all the humans invading our dragon lands out of Dragon Continent...</p><p></p><p>As for the divine lords' wrath upon their return..."</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shaduo fell silent for a moment, then continued, "No matter what, I believe the continuation of our race is more important than our individual selves. So the divine lords' wrath, as long as it preserves the survival of our race, is of no consequence."</p><p></p><p>After listening to the dragon mother Shaduo's words, Su Hao said seriously, "Mother Shaduo, please rest assured, the giant dragon race will not go extinct in the short term. At the very least, you will not see the extinction of the giant dragon race - I guarantee it. For now, just hide in this space, and I will resolve this matter very soon."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Su Hao teleported away.</p><p></p><p>The avatar discussing with the dragon gods in the small world suddenly changed the topic, "By the way, I heard you mention earlier that you could help me capture the human gods?"</p><p></p><p>The gods looked at each other, startled and puzzled.</p><p></p><p>What was Lei'an trying to do? He couldn't be taking the opportunity to make a move, could he?</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu didn't care whether Su Hao was telling the truth or not and boldly said, "As long as we leave the aura of our divine avatars on you, and you use the method I taught you to block remote viewing from each human god,</p><p></p><p>you can go out for a stroll. Those human gods will inevitably send their avatars to investigate, and you can capture all the gods in one fell swoop...of course, only if you have that ability."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "Okay, then leave your avatar auras on me now!"</p><p></p><p>The gods all looked at each other in consternation.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly didn't understand what this Lei'an was trying to do.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The human gods had been closely watching the changes on the battlefield, anticipating the appearance of the dragon gods' avatars.</p><p></p><p>From their perspective, if the dragon gods' avatars appeared before their army invaded the ancestral lands, it would likely indicate the dragon gods did indeed want to ambush them, which would put their minds at ease.</p><p></p><p>But if the dragon gods failed to appear even after the army entered the ancestral lands, then there was a big problem.</p><p></p><p>It must mean the dragon gods had collectively encountered some accident, preventing them from appearing even if facing extinction, or perhaps...they had met with misfortune?</p><p></p><p>What kind of situation could befall the immortal gods who had lived on this planet for who knows how many years? No matter how they imagined it, they couldn't figure out what could kill the gods.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the gods fervently hoped the dragon gods were just playing a prank on them and had not actually met with misfortune.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - whatever could kill the dragon gods could also kill them.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it sent chills down their spines - what a terrifying existence that would be.</p><p></p><p>The human gods waited silently, then suddenly all opened their eyes wide, looking at each other in astonishment as they could see the surprise in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because just a moment ago, they all sensed the auras they had been eagerly awaiting - those of the five dragon gods!</p><p></p><p>None of the gods spoke on the surface, all wearing solemn expressions. But they couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief inwardly: as expected, those crafty old dragons were up to no good.</p><p></p><p>Those sighing in relief included the Night God Yongshi and the Golden God Bali. However, given their previous experiences, they did not let their guard down.</p><p></p><p>The Salvation God Baishen laughed first, "Let me send my servants to see what tricks those sly old dragons are playing!"</p><p></p><p>Not just the Salvation God Baishen, but the other gods also began taking action, each using their own methods to observe from afar the place where the auras of the five dragon gods had appeared.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao had made preparations, and without exception, none of the gods made any discoveries.</p><p></p><p>The Order God Hongguang suggested, "Why don't we go over and see what tricks these dragon gods are trying to play? Things have developed to this point, and in the end we still have to fight it out. At that time, we'll each rely on our own strengths and see whose avatars last the longest before being overwhelmed."</p><p></p><p>The Order God Hongguang finished speaking with a confident look on his face, clearly having prepared for this for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the others hesitating slightly, Hongguang said impatiently, "What, you all don't want to go over? You want me to go get killed alone?"</p><p></p><p>If he could defeat those dragons alone, he wouldn't be here.</p><p></p><p>The Salvation God Baishen laughed lightly, "Of course we won't let you go alone. We human gods have always been united. Why don't we all go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>The Light God Yi nodded, "Once we see those old dragons, we'll understand what tricks they're trying to play. We'll accompany you to the end then."</p><p></p><p>The gods all agreed and set off flying towards the location where they sensed the dragon gods' avatars.</p><p></p><p>As they were about to approach the area with the dragon gods' auras, the Night God Yongshi's expression changed drastically and he hurriedly said, "Everyone go on ahead, the cave where my main body resides has collapsed..."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, without waiting for the other gods to react, he immediately turned and ran, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bali looked on dumbfounded, then his expression also changed drastically as he made up an excuse, "Everyone, it was my lover's affair that caused Lord Yongshi's cave to collapse. I must return immediately to deal with it."</p><p></p><p>He also ran off without a trace after speaking.</p><p></p><p>Having experienced the heavenly passage, they had developed a certain shadow when facing that mysterious god, unwilling to get too close, because they were well aware that once within a certain range, their avatars would become targets, and they might even lose another avatar.</p><p></p><p>The other gods' expressions turned ugly - using such unbelievable excuses to deceive them.</p><p></p><p>The Salvation God Baishen mocked, "Two cowardly rats. Let's go, we'll go ourselves. All gains from this will have nothing to do with those two."</p><p></p><p>The human gods all took turns ridiculing the cowardly pair of Yongshi and Bali, then continued forward.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, each of them became more cautious, highly focused and alert to everything around them.</p><p></p><p>Each of them thought about slowing down and hiding at the back of the group.</p><p></p><p>This was the so-called divine-level skill 'Sense Something Amiss, Quietly Hide Among the Crowd'.</p><p></p><p>But when every single member of a small team possessed this divine skill, the situation became rather awkward as the group moved slower and slower.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they stopped, looking at each other.</p>

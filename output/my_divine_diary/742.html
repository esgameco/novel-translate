        <h1>Chapter 742</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The notice from the Compound Eye Race was quickly sent to the Blue Light, and after being passed around, it ended up in the hands of the leader, Xia Qingjun.</p><p></p><p>The notice included accusations and demands against humans, and also attached a high-definition video clip.</p><p></p><p>After watching it, Xia Qingjun was dumbfounded: "We humans used space technology to capture more than a hundred members of the Compound Eye Race and conducted inhumanely cruel experiments on them?"</p><p></p><p>He turned to his secretary and asked, "Do we have such a plan? I don't recall anything like this happening! Moreover, looking at how the Compound Eyes suddenly disappeared in the video, it doesn't seem like we have that kind of technology, do we?"</p><p></p><p>The secretary quickly responded, "Leader, after receiving this notice, we have conducted a comprehensive search but haven't found any related projects.</p><p></p><p>The Foreign Affairs Office responsible for liaising with the Compound Eye Race is currently doing a more thorough investigation, and I believe we'll have results soon.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, based on the situation in the video, it's clear that we indeed do not possess the corresponding technology to achieve that."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun nodded. After pondering while watching the video, he suddenly said, "Go and summon General Gong Liangzhong. I have something to ask him."</p><p></p><p>"Understood. One moment."</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, the plump captain came in.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun headed towards the quiet room, saying as he walked, "General Gong Liangzhong, come with me."</p><p></p><p>The captain followed with a smile, "The leader actually has time to invite me for tea!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun paused, turned to the secretary with a smile, and said, "General Gong Liangzhong wants to have tea. Go and brew us a pot!"</p><p></p><p>The captain's eyes lit up. "It's not often that one gets to enjoy the leader's fine tea! Looks like I'm lucky today."</p><p></p><p>After entering the quiet room, they engaged in casual conversation. Once the secretary had brewed the tea and left, closing the door behind him, Xia Qingjun showed the video from the Compound Eye Race to the captain.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun said, "Take a look at this first, and then we'll talk."</p><p></p><p>The captain did as instructed. After watching, he was stunned and exclaimed in amazement, "Hey? This looks just like Xu Shiqiang's supernatural abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun smiled and said, "That's what I thought too, so I called you here to confirm.</p><p></p><p>One hundred and ten members of the Compound Eye Race disappeared from their planet without a trace. The disappearance scene is similar to what we saw. They suspect it was the work of us humans, but we have no such plan.</p><p></p><p>So I wanted to ask you if you know anything about this. Whether you do or don't, I'll have an idea in my mind."</p><p></p><p>The captain watched the video again while pondering, then said uncertainly, "About ten years ago, Dasheng asked me for other intelligent alien races for his research, and I did send him quite a few.</p><p></p><p>I remember him saying, 'It's best if there are Compound Eyes, but it's fine if there aren't.' I even advised him not to provoke the Compound Eye Race.</p><p></p><p>And not long ago, Jia Fengcheng came asking me for information about the Compound Eye Race. I didn't think too much of it and just sent him everything I had.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way... there's a possibility it's related to Dasheng..."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the captain exchanged a glance. This matter was more or less confirmed at this point!</p><p></p><p>The captain said in a low voice, "Is this matter serious?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun said with a headache, "It's not that it's not serious, but it is quite serious, because the Compound Eyes are a stubborn bunch who won't listen to reason.</p><p></p><p>Either they'll insist it has nothing to do with us humans, or they'll send out a 'special investigation team' to help the Compound Eyes investigate, then find a reasonable excuse to smooth things over and downplay the incident... Neither option can guarantee a complete resolution!"</p><p></p><p>The captain pondered and said, "Leader, have you considered reaching out to Dasheng to get a sense of things? If you explain the situation to him, it might be resolved quickly."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun frowned, "Dasheng's research on the Compound Eyes must have his reasons. As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather fully support his research and help clear any obstacles for him, instead of putting pressure on him."</p><p></p><p>The captain couldn't help but give Xia Qingjun a mental thumbs up, thinking to himself, "The leader really is the most insightful person."</p><p></p><p>He then said, "We're not putting pressure on Dasheng, but rather seeking his opinion, since this matter may be related to him to some extent. He has the right to be informed."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun nodded, "You make a fair point. Then you can be the one to communicate with Dasheng about this."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Leader!" The captain responded, but showed no intention of leaving.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun looked puzzled, "Was there anything else?"</p><p></p><p>The captain pointed at the teapot, "We haven't finished drinking the tea yet. We can't let it go to waste."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When the captain entered the small world, he couldn't find Su Hao, but he was prepared for this. His rich experience told him that if he couldn't find Su Hao, it would be the same with anyone else.</p><p></p><p>So he cupped his hands around his mouth like a megaphone and called out in a loud voice, "Dasheng? Mr. Jia Yashan? Mr. Jia Fengcheng?"</p><p></p><p>Before long, a young man with short hair and a faint smile on his face came out, walking and saying, "Well, if it isn't General Gong! What brings you here? But let me say this first, if it's business, then it's business. Don't try to invite me to go find some girls."</p><p></p><p>It was Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>The captain laughed so hard that the flesh on his face piled up. "If I don't go, then there's no point in me going alone. To go find girls, a few guys have to go together to make it fun."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng laughed heartily, "That's the way it is. If Old Wei and Old Yashan took the lead in finding girls, then it would be really exciting!"</p><p></p><p>The captain asked curiously, "Dasheng and Yashan don't have such interests?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng explained, "They must have their interests, but given the current situation, those are just low-level pleasures. When there are more important matters, they'll definitely prioritize the more important things.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps when time becomes less pressing, all sorts of interests will emerge on their own.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, I'm really looking forward to Old Wei taking me out to wander around in the future. Not to do anything particularly grand, but just casual sightseeing and traveling - I feel it would be endlessly enjoyable.</p><p></p><p>But for now! Don't tempt me, General Gong. I should follow the example of the two elders and focus on studying diligently."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng also felt a sense of urgency within himself. He didn't want to fall too far behind Su Hao and Yashan.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that he wouldn't even have the qualifications to play mahjong with them, let alone follow Old Wei in traveling and sightseeing.</p><p></p><p>It was like now - if he couldn't even learn the 'Star Journey'...</p><p></p><p>One could imagine a scenario: Old Wei would blink and travel from one galaxy to another, then casually land on a planet and call out, "Fengcheng, come play mahjong!"</p><p></p><p>How would he get there?</p><p></p><p>As for Fengcheng's words, the captain only half understood, nodding and saying, "You make a good point!"</p><p></p><p>Then he changed the subject and lowered his voice, "Fengcheng, could you help me out? Just pass a message to Dasheng that I need to see him, and ask when he's available to meet."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng asked curiously, "What's it about?"</p><p></p><p>The captain then briefly explained the situation with the Compound Eye Race.</p><p></p><p>He added, "I think we need to confirm things with Dasheng, so we know how to respond to the Compound Eyes' subsequent actions."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Fengcheng immediately realized it was Old Wei's doing.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand dismissively, "Ah, I thought it was something else. It was definitely Old Wei's work. He went to the Compound Eye planet not long ago."</p><p></p><p>The captain breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this, "With this, we have a better understanding."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Whatever Old Wei wants to do, he'll just do it. You all don't need to take the Compound Eyes too seriously. Even a formidable force like the Eight-Armed Race was handled and subdued by Old Wei. What are the Compound Eyes in comparison?</p><p></p><p>It's their luck that Old Wei is paying attention to them. If they didn't have some special qualities, Old Wei wouldn't even look at them!"</p><p></p><p>The captain thought to himself, "No wonder they speak with such a big attitude after following Dasheng. But the key is that they really are powerful, so there's no point arguing!</p><p></p><p>If I had their strength, my attitude would probably be even bigger than theirs.</p><p></p><p>It's strange, though. After all these years of diligent cultivation, why haven't I been able to gain greater power? Where did I go wrong? Could it be that I lack the talent for cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>The captain pondered and then said, "Fengcheng, do you still need to inform Dasheng?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng nodded, "I'll let Old Wei know. As for you all... just do whatever you need to do. If the Compound Eyes don't cooperate properly, then bring the battleships to their home planet and occupy it, then make them cooperate!"</p><p></p><p>The captain was a bit dazed. "Occupy the Compound Eye planet?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng looked puzzled, "That way, they can better cooperate with Old Wei's experiments. Is there a problem?"</p><p></p><p>After following Su Hao and Yashan for so long, Fengcheng saw this as the best solution. In his view, there was no better way to resolve the issue.</p><p></p><p>The captain replied hesitantly, "No... no problem. I think the plan is good..."</p>

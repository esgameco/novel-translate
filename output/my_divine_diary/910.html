        <h1>Chapter 910</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>On the Palace Island in the Brave World, the Ten Cross Stars.</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister came to the small platform at the top of the palace, gazing out at the distant sea.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei looked at his sister's back and sighed, "Sister, apart from Mengli and the other six, the rest of our disciples have crossed over from their hometowns. How should we interact with them going forward?"</p><p></p><p>Without turning her head, Cong Shuling replied, "However it goes, that's how it will be. We are their masters, they are our disciples, it's that simple."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Now facing these disciples, I can still maintain an outward aura of mysterious grandeur, but I feel a bit strange inside. It's like the powerful secret that allows us to be their masters has been revealed to them. I feel I've lost my former self-confidence in front of them."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling shook her head, "It's not like that, Xiaofei. On the contrary, now that we all know each other came from our hometowns, there is less condescension between us. Haven't you noticed? Since they learned our true identities, an unspoken closeness has emerged, their gaze upon us has become much calmer, as if looking at their own kind.</p><p></p><p>Before, it wasn't like this. These disciples' attitudes towards us always had a subtle aloofness, as if thinking: 'I may not be as powerful as you now, but one day I will surpass you.'</p><p></p><p>I thought it was just the innate arrogance of talented disciples, but now I realize that wasn't the case. In reality, these disciples simply didn't take us seriously."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Cong Renfei nodded in agreement, "It does seem that way. Recalling their subtle behavior, wasn't it just looking down on us? Damn, these brats were too much, actually looking down on their own masters!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling laughed, "I didn't understand why before, but now I get it. Before knowing each other's identities, not only did they look down on us, we also looked down on these disciples.</p><p></p><p>For some inexplicable reason, we who possessed systems and thus infinite possibilities saw ourselves as superior and looked down on everyone else.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this mentality was deeply buried within us. Now it's different - everyone is a system host with a high starting point and nearly limitless potential, so no one looks down on anyone else. We can view each other as equals.</p><p></p><p>It's still the same, we are the masters, they are the disciples."</p><p></p><p>It seemed Cong Renfei's doubts were resolved, and he chuckled, "Ah, so that's why the system issued us the mission to take in disciples."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "Xiaofei, it's only now that I know what we should teach these disciples."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei asked in surprise, "Teach what?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling replied, "Pass on the knowledge our master imparted to us, and truly guide them onto this path of exploration."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "Won't our master blame us?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "No, I remember our master said that knowledge only has value when passed on, because there will always be talents who create even deeper things based on it. Our role is to guide the true talents onto this path. However..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling turned to gaze into the distance, her eyes firm, "Before spreading that knowledge, there is something else we need to do first."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "What's that?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "Go find the Great Demon King Chipu."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "Uhâ€”"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu had been in an excellent mood recently, always cheerful. Even when his little nephews ran amok in his castle, he didn't get angry but even took the time to teach them some fighting skills.</p><p></p><p>This was because he had just had a great fight and beaten the so-called 'Brave Heroes' who dared provoke him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their shock at his power, seeing their expressions of helplessness despite using all their strength against the Great Demon King Chipu, it was as sweet as eating the most delicious honey in the world, making his whole body tingle with pleasure.</p><p></p><p>So halfway through, the Great Demon King Chipu changed his mind and decided not to kill these little guys who brought him joy, but to let them go when he got the chance. He hoped their strength would increase so they could come fight him again in the future, bringing a bit of enjoyment to his life.</p><p></p><p>He especially wanted to see their shocked expressions again.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he thought of this, the Great Demon King Chipu's eyes would narrow and he couldn't help but guffaw loudly.</p><p></p><p>The tremendous sound reverberated, knocking over many of the surrounding baby red-gold dragons who got up dazedly looking at their demon king uncle.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Demon King Chipu was laughing uproariously, another demon king came running in shouting, "Reporting to the Great Demon King Chipu, those two humans are heading this way again from the eastern sea. Based on our subordinates' analysis, they must be coming for you."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu's eyes lit up and he grinned, "Good timing, they must have learned some powerful spells and want to try defeating me. Hahaha! I'll go meet them and let them know who is truly the strongest in this world."</p><p></p><p>With that, his enormous body rose with a rumbling sound and he strode out heavily, each step shaking the entire castle.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>A piece of rubble fell from the ceiling, striking another baby dragon that had gotten up and knocking it back down.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu spread his wings and with a "whoosh" took flight, disappearing from sight in an instant.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei's movements, as well as the Great Demon King Chipu's, quickly attracted the attention of the deities.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, there's a situation, stop playing games and come see what's happening."</p><p></p><p>Soon the deities had gathered in the heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>Nati said unhappily, "Bali, don't talk nonsense if you don't understand. I wasn't playing games, I was using the little deity learning machine! Finding a bit of happiness every day - someone obsessed with games wouldn't understand."</p><p></p><p>A few other deities also claimed they were studying, not playing games.</p><p></p><p>Bali said helplessly, "Alright, alright, you self-deluding deities really can't take a word. Just look at what's going on. The Gail siblings are heading straight for the Great Demon King Chipu, but we didn't issue a corresponding mission. What are those two trying to do? Challenge the Great Demon King to a deathmatch?"</p><p></p><p>The deities quickly noticed the anomaly and, no longer bickering, watched in shock as Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei went straight for the Great Demon King Chipu. After sensing the incoming enemies, Chipu also charged straight at the two siblings.</p><p></p><p>Seeing an epic battle was about to unfold, the deities panicked...</p><p></p><p>They were all too familiar with the current strength of the two siblings - they were no match for the Great Demon King Chipu at all. Going over like this, weren't they just throwing away their lives?</p><p></p><p>"It's possible, never thought the world will could actually take the initiative to commit suicide..."</p><p></p><p>"What should we do, should we temporarily create a mission to make them retreat?"</p><p></p><p>"No, if the two siblings insist on going and don't accept the mission, there's nothing we can do. Plus issuing a mission now would make them sense the anomaly, going beyond the mission rules."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, what is the world will thinking? Before there were cases of mutual slaughter, now there's even voluntary suicide. Incomprehensible."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The two siblings flew rapidly over the sea surface. Soon their pupils constricted as they sensed the Great Demon King Chipu's spiritual presence tens of thousands of meters away, but their speed didn't decrease at all.</p><p></p><p>Before long, they saw a small black dot appear on the distant sea - it was the Great Demon King Chipu, accompanied by his trademark laughter. The two sides stopped a few hundred meters apart, squaring off.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu roared with laughter, "Humans, though insignificant before me, you are the strongest I've ever encountered. You have the honor of me remembering your names. Announce yourselves, then let me beat you senseless!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling shouted loudly, "Great Demon King Chipu, we acknowledge your power, but we didn't come to fight you this time. We don't yet have confidence we can defeat you."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu said in surprise, "Oh? Then did you come to drink with me? I don't mind inviting you into my castle for a few barrels of wine. Hahaha, how amusing."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling then sent the Great Demon King Chipu a party invitation request.</p><p></p><p>"Request sent, awaiting reply!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "..."</p>

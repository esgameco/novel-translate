        <h1>Chapter 641</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Upon learning the news, people around the world were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Although many did not understand the stakes involved, it did not stop them from joining in on the excitement and participating in the discussions with their companions.</p><p></p><p>"Have you seen the before and after photos of Key Star? It's truly shocking! This must be something only a divine being could accomplish?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course I've seen them. I even saved the whole set of pictures! Especially that last one with a dazzling pillar of light shooting out from the planet - so awesome!"</p><p></p><p>"To experience such a historic event in person, I can die without regrets now."</p><p></p><p>"I'm really curious how this was achieved."</p><p></p><p>"It must have been the work of the world's strongest wizard, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Could even the strongest wizard do something like this? I'm not so sure!"</p><p></p><p>"What if those are just fake photoshopped pictures for publicity? It doesn't look real at all."</p><p></p><p>"Hey! They're not fake. That night, I saw a bright beam flash across the sky through my telescope. It lasted a really long time. Not just me, many others saw it too."</p><p></p><p>"Can humans really reach such heights?"</p><p></p><p>"Hard to say, maybe it was a deity!"</p><p></p><p>"I wish I could become a wizard! Too bad I don't have the talent..."</p><p></p><p>"I heard you can become a wizard even without talent!"</p><p></p><p>"Really? True or not?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In New Era City, the former "Harmony Citadel" remained.</p><p></p><p>However, the current master was no longer Lada, but his former assistant Dumond who had taken over.</p><p></p><p>Dumond had also been imprisoned on the island by Su Hao for a time, being called the person closest to that man. He was then directly appointed by Lada as the next Harmony Wizard.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Dumond may not have even exchanged a single word with Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Dumond was quite old now and didn't seem to have much time left. Another "Harmony Wizard" would need to be chosen soon.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't have a suitable candidate, as almost all the wizards who had contact with Su Hao were gone. If he chose a "Harmony Wizard" without sufficient understanding of "Javis", who then messed around recklessly, it would be a disaster for the Wizards' Association.</p><p></p><p>In Dumond's view, Feiyu was the best candidate to be the next Harmony Wizard. However, no matter how he communicated with Feiyu, he was unwilling to take this position.</p><p></p><p>The coveted "Harmony Wizard" position that all wizards in the world craved, with power rivaling a world emperor and the highest honor, was actually being rejected by Feiyu like a worn-out shoe.</p><p></p><p>He really couldn't understand why anyone would ignore such temptation.</p><p></p><p>However, after the news about Key Star spread, Dumond no longer worried about who would succeed the "Harmony Wizard" position.</p><p></p><p>Because no matter who succeeded it, it was irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>Any sane person, after learning about the Key Star incident, should understand the terrifying power of "Mr. Javis" and would not recklessly bring the Wizards' Association to ruin.</p><p></p><p>He even fanned the flames by actively spreading the Key Star news through the Wizards' Association's channels.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the conference hall, the high-ranking members of the Wizards' Association, numbering in the hundreds, sat neatly and discussed the Key Star incident.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some also expressed doubts, to which the Harmony Wizard Dumond simply smiled faintly and said, "There's no need for doubt, this is the handiwork of 'Mr. Javis'. I have received confirmation through special channels.</p><p></p><p>And I admit that you are all the most powerful, most outstanding, and most learned wizards in the world - calling you geniuses would not be an overstatement. But you must know that in this world, there are people beyond people, heavens beyond heavens. We must acknowledge that there will always be those more formidable than us, those who can accomplish what we cannot.</p><p></p><p>My friends, is it really so difficult to acknowledge others' superiority?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell silent, staring at the photo evidence in front of them, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Dumond continued, "Mr. Javis is from our era. Only us old folks truly understand how powerful he is! I can say with certainty, it's not at all surprising that Mr. Javis could do what he did to Key Star - he could even destroy the planet we're standing on!</p><p></p><p>Listen to me: Revere this heaven and earth! Perhaps there were no 'deities' before, but now there is one - Mr. Javis himself!"</p><p></p><p>Only Dumond's raspy voice echoed in the hall, not loud but filled with an inexplicable force that stirred a sense of reverence in everyone's hearts, silently chanting: "Mr. Javis, a deity? An omnipotent god!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately followed by an indescribable dread: "He can destroy the world, so he must be the supreme deity!"</p><p></p><p>Not just the Wizards' Association, but other emerging organizations as well held meetings to discuss this Key Star incident.</p><p></p><p>For these people, suddenly discovering this unfamiliar, inexplicable world with a powerful "deity" who could treat an entire planet like a toy was jarring.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they couldn't help but act more cautiously, considering the consequences.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the small base world, when Yashan and Fengcheng saw Su Hao rarely half-lying by the poolside pavilion reading, they hurried over, very surprised. "Old Master, what's the deal with the particle beam on Key Star? For a moment I thought Key Star was going to collapse into a black hole from the gravity."</p><p></p><p>Even Feiyu came over, seemingly wanting to inquire about the details too.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stood up and stretched, saying leisurely, "This is the 'Planetary Virus' I've been researching all these years, specifically designed to destroy planets in case a large celestial body ever comes hurtling towards us in the future so we're not helpless."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were shaken, immediately recalling the previous life's feeling of powerlessness against the incoming asteroid, having to resort to self-destructing in a final desperate attempt...</p><p></p><p>So Old Master had been preparing for resolving threats from large celestial bodies all this time!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "You did very well back then, Yashan."</p><p></p><p>As for Fengcheng, he had no such drive to catch up, after all, the two great masters were meant to be looked up to - it was impossible for him to catch up.</p><p></p><p>When he was still lounging in the Music Immortal Palace, the two masters were already studying and researching. In his current state, how could he catch up? He could only strive to not fall too far behind.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng felt an surge of desire to learn again, glancing at the level his assistant showed - elementary school library!</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng thought to himself: "I've already reached the 'library' level, I should be able to get to 'computer' soon! Keep at it Fengcheng!"</p><p></p><p>Feiyu stood by, utterly confused: "What planetary virus?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao explained casually, "Just like a plague virus, it can infect and corrode a planet from the inside, destroying it."</p><p></p><p>The three of them looked amazed: "It can do that?!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "The ruckus on Key Star was just me testing the functions of the virus. But it hasn't succeeded yet, I'm still finding inspiration on how to perfect it."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said it so calmly, but just imagining that scene was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Yashan and the others could no longer look at the word "virus" directly. Just hearing those two words would probably give them goosebumps.</p><p></p><p>The first thing they thought of was the nanobots from the virtual world, devouring matter while self-replicating, until eventually consuming all matter they touched, leaving nothing behind - not even animals or humans would be spared. In the end, the entire planet would become a world of nanobots...</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it filled them with dread, yet also excitement.</p><p></p><p>Dread at how virtually unstoppable such a "virus" would be, excitement that their Old Master possessed such technology.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but exclaim again: "Old Master, you're just too formidable!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao burst into hearty laughter: "It's alright! As long as you study diligently, think deeply, experiment boldly... you'll eventually be able to accomplish things ordinary people cannot.</p><p></p><p>And don't praise me so much yet - wait until I've truly completed the 'Planetary Virus' before saying that!"</p><p></p><p>In truth, having others recognize one's prowess was still a pleasant feeling.</p>

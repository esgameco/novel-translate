        <h1>Chapter 996</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>How can one enhance their perceptive abilities?</p><p></p><p>But if only it were that simple.</p><p></p><p>Deep down, Su Hao was clear that if he could not analyze the underlying logic of 'perceptive power', no matter how long he sat in meditation, his spiritual power would be difficult to make any progress.</p><p></p><p>So what is the underlying logic of perceptive power?</p><p></p><p>For hearing, if one wants to enhance their perception of sounds on this basis, they need to specifically modify their ears to allow them to receive ultrasounds or infrasounds, and transmit clear signals to the brain.</p><p></p><p>As long as the modification is successful, it can be said that after 'cultivation', the perceptive power has successfully broken through and been enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Simple, right?</p><p></p><p>But what needs to be noted is that this kind of cultivation must be targeted. You can't cultivate your eyes and expect your ears to also undergo a metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>So for Su Hao to enhance his perceptive abilities, in order to successfully sense the existence of the Ping-Pong Space after reincarnation, the principle is the same.</p><p></p><p>What he needs to perceive is not infrasound, but the Ping-Pong Space. He needs to modify his perceptive power according to the characteristics of the Ping-Pong Space.</p><p></p><p>"The Ping-Pong Space may not necessarily have a specific form in the material world, and my current perceptive methods may not be able to detect its existence. What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly found a corresponding approach: "Work on three aspects. First, diversify my own perceptive power by making spiritual eyes from all the Xun-series materials I've acquired over the years and connecting them to my brain.</p><p></p><p>The third is the way the Ping-Pong Space records external information - during the recording process, it affects fluctuations in the external world, and then encodes these effects in a specific way, so that I can perceive its existence from the external world."</p><p></p><p>He believed that as long as these three points were successfully completed, the possibility of perceiving the Ping-Pong Space would be very high.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Su Hao's form manifested in the Ping-Pong Space, floating in this river of information.</p><p></p><p>The first difficulty lay before him: how to distinguish the inside and outside of the Ping-Pong Space?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao muttered, "This...is really giving me a headache."</p><p></p><p>This problem was indeed quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>He wandered endlessly within the Ping-Pong Space, trying to find a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness information, like a string of numbers between (0,1), wandered everywhere within this interval, but no matter what, could not touch the boundary of this range.</p><p></p><p>After wandering for who knows how long, Su Hao stopped helplessly: "This direction has fallen into a dead loop, there's no way to break through, I have to find another way."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, no need to find the inside and outside, just study the input and output ends of the information directly."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly adjusted his state and began categorizing and studying the latest information inputted into the Ping-Pong Space.</p><p></p><p>He was very skilled in this kind of research, because he had been doing it since he first established Xiaoguan.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and one day twenty years later, facing the onslaught of various problems, Su Hao couldn't help but sigh again: "Really giving me a headache..."</p><p></p><p>But after sighing, his helpless expression suddenly froze, then gradually turned to astonishment: "Headache...head? Brain?"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, maybe if I change my perspective, everything will be solved."</p><p></p><p>He gradually became excited.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the state of the Ping-Pong Space very similar to that of a brain?"</p><p></p><p>"If I analogize the Ping-Pong Space as a giant's brain, then everything makes sense."</p><p></p><p>"The Ping-Pong Space is a 'brain' capable of storing vast amounts of information, and I can be regarded as the main consciousness within this brain.</p><p></p><p>The problem I'm facing now is that this giant's brain has no eyes to see, no ears to hear, no nose to smell, and no body to sense.</p><p></p><p>Just like a person whose all perceptions are sealed off, but can still think. Apart from thinking, they cannot do anything else."</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, if I don't have a physical body to move freely, isn't my predicament like that of a conscious but vegetative state?</p><p></p><p>This giant Ping-Pong Space brain has extremely powerful thinking abilities. In terms of thinking, it is almost omnipotent, and can even subconsciously receive information from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is, it is only a brain, without the corresponding eyes, nose, mouth, ears, hands and body. To the point where it cannot even perceive where it is, cannot stop wandering in the universe, and can only roam aimlessly driven by instinct."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao clenched his fists tightly, his eyes full of excitement: "In other words, if I can find a way to equip this Ping-Pong Space brain with eyes, then as the consciousness of this brain, I will be able to see.</p><p></p><p>If I can find a way to equip this brain with hands and feet, then I will be able to control my movements."</p><p></p><p>"As a brain, I need to equip myself with a body! Once I successfully equip a body, all my problems will be solved.</p><p></p><p>So, do I have a way to equip the Ping-Pong Space with eyes and ears?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took a deep breath, then exhaled slowly: "There must be a way. The Ping-Pong Space itself can receive information from the outside world and send information out, these two points are enough."</p><p></p><p>Being able to receive information means I have a way to build perceptive systems like eyes and ears - installing built-in eyes and ears is not unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>Being able to send information out to the external world means I can control external matter. As long as I have matter I can control, I can turn it into hands and feet...</p><p></p><p>With his current level of technology and thinking, achieving this is feasible. It may be rudimentary at first, but as time goes on, the giant's body he envisions will become more and more perfect.</p><p></p><p>"If my Ping-Pong brain successfully acquires a physical body, then to a certain extent, I will have completely mastered the Ping-Pong Space. At that time, the sudden accidents I was worried about, I will have the ability to avoid.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, after successfully building the 'Ping-Pong body', my main body will become the Ping-Pong body, and I have a great possibility of making contact with the 'non-material universe' through this special Ping-Pong body, and embark on another brand new path of exploration."</p><p></p><p>By then, it won't matter where the Ping-Pong Space is.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's mind raced, considering the possibilities of the Ping-Pong body, recording all his thoughts and constantly refining this plan.</p><p></p><p>"First, try to make an 'eye', to observe the outside of the Ping-Pong Space. Well...calling it an eye, it's more like a specific light signal receiver.</p><p></p><p>This difficulty shouldn't be too great, just need to categorize and encode all the information recorded into the Ping-Pong Space. As for how this eye associates with consciousness information, it's similar to 'avatar control', and I have plenty of consciousness information for experimentation, so no problem...</p><p></p><p>At first I may only be able to receive some simple scattered information, unable to form the scenery visible to the naked eye. But I can try to capture some of the matter I encounter by transmitting specific signals outward, making it attach to the outside of the Ping-Pong Space.</p><p></p><p>Then use this matter to make a fully functional 'eye', so I can see farther and clearer.</p><p></p><p>Of course, I can also make ears, hands, feet, a body..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's research on certain materials was extremely deep, and he was very clear on which types of materials would be affected by which specific signals.</p><p></p><p>So as long as he could 'see' the corresponding materials from the perspective of the Ping-Pong Space, using signals to capture the materials was achievable.</p><p></p><p>Once he could obtain materials from the Ping-Pong Space's perspective, he could use those materials to make anything he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's steps for making a body were simply summarized as: 1. Make a barely usable eye; 2. After seeing matter, try to capture it with specific signals; 3. Use the captured matter to make real eyes and a body.</p><p></p><p>After clarifying his thoughts, Su Hao quickly took action and began designing the 'eye' of the Ping-Pong body.</p><p></p><p>"After making the eye, try to capture matter. If successful in obtaining matter, it means this Ping-Pong body plan is feasible."</p><p></p><p>This was the key point, and also the difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Being able to capture matter in theory does not mean it can actually be done.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it will be much harder than he imagined.</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't even understand the essence of the Ping-Pong Space.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao did not lack time. He had plenty of time to try, and having a new perspective was already great progress.</p><p></p><p>At worst, if he failed, he could just continue with his previous 'waiting for reincarnation' plan.</p>

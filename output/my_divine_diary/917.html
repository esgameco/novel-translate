        <h1>Chapter 917</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Feng Cheng took his disciples and grand-disciples to tour around the entire Xiang Hu system, observing this galaxy from various angles.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they arrived in front of the black hole at the center of the Xiang Hu system.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng pointed at the black hole and said, "That is the center of this entire Xiang Hu system. What secrets are hidden there, even I have no way of knowing. Perhaps in the future when you all become extremely powerful, you may be able to step onto this behemoth."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and the others blankly stared at the huge shadow and arcs of light in front of them, their minds going blank, perhaps not even hearing what Feng Cheng said.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Our tour will stop here for now. Let's go back!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he transported everyone back to their exclusive small world.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere fell into a prolonged silence. </p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng did not rush them, quietly waiting for them to absorb what they had seen today.</p><p></p><p>Putting himself in their shoes, when the great Master Wei first took him to witness the stars and universe, his shock was no less than Cong Shuling and the others.</p><p></p><p>It was from that time that, apart from following Master Wei, he was also deeply fascinated by the mysteries of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Since he was going to take in disciples, he hoped that his disciples and grand-disciples would also truly fall in love with exploring the universe. Otherwise, eternal life and power would just be a torment.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng raised his head, his eyes full of excitement, "Ancestral Master, can I...can I also freely roam and explore the universe like you?"</p><p></p><p>The others also fixed their gazes on Feng Cheng, full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled and nodded, "As long as you truly love it, of course you can."</p><p></p><p>Everyone trembled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Even the Demon King Chi Pu could not control his wings, flapping them unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng continued, "This time, I brought you all away from the Tenth Star to teach you the true knowledge of exploring the universe. So now I ask you, are you willing to spend a thousand years learning all kinds of knowledge and techniques from me?"</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple is willing!"</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a thousand years, if they could roam the starry skies, they would be willing to study for ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>What they feared was having no opportunity to learn, and even more fearful was having the chance but being unable to learn.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One year later, Su Hao completed the structural design of the 'Divine Plan' for the White Dwarf and went to meet the gods in heaven.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Your Excellencies the gods, after my careful design, I have come up with a preliminary plan to transform the White Dwarf's body. Next, it will be up to you all to work hard to build the corresponding structure. This process may be a bit long, but I believe it is worth it for Your Excellencies to gain free bodies."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he sent the specific plan through the small black room to the gods' systems.</p><p></p><p>The gods opened it to take a look and immediately felt dizzy.</p><p></p><p>The Pillar God Nati struggled to close the system and said in a conflicted tone, "Lord Lei An, this is too complicated...I don't think we have the ability to complete such a huge project."</p><p></p><p>The other gods deeply agreed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "The structure looks very complicated, but it's actually not. The inside of this structure is very simple, built from countless special three-layer 'T' structures.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, you just need to build countless simple structures, stack them together according to the structure I have set, and then solidify them.</p><p></p><p>It's not difficult to do, but it will take some time and patience."</p><p></p><p>The gods thought to themselves, "Even if you say that, we still think it's very difficult..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "All beginnings are difficult, but as long as you make up your mind and take the first step, you will find that every step after that is difficult...</p><p></p><p>But what does it matter? Your Excellencies should know that strength does not come easily, nor does freedom. What you want, you still need to strive for yourselves. All I can give you is a plan."</p><p></p><p>The gods thought, "The words are true, but..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually took out a [God] body, placed it in front of the gods, transformed it into a human form in front of them, while his own controlled body reverted to the original [God] form.</p><p></p><p>Then he said, "Do you see? This is the highest-grade body I have prepared for you. Even I am using the same model - extremely powerful. As long as you maintain it according to the instructions, theoretically there is no lifespan limit.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you accidentally damage the body, you can use points to repair it. If you have enough points, you can also directly order a new one from the mall. As long as you protect your soul and will, there won't be a big problem."</p><p></p><p>The body personally used by Lord Lei An...</p><p></p><p>The gods admitted they were tempted.</p><p></p><p>Bali immediately said, "No matter how difficult, as Lord Lei An said, as long as we take the first step, success is not far away. Lord Lei An rest assured, I will build the structure of the White Dwarf's body to perfection."</p><p></p><p>The other gods no longer cared about the loophole in Bali's words, all expressing full support for Lord Lei An's project.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Then it's up to you all. Whenever you complete it and successfully debug it, that's when you'll gain your freedom."</p><p></p><p>After leaving heaven, Su Hao returned to the experimental base, entered the pinball space, and began writing the software for the 'Divine Plan'.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A hundred years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In a hundred years, mortals experience a lifetime of birth, aging, sickness and death. But for transcendent immortals, this period of time was just a fleeting moment.</p><p></p><p>On an inconspicuous planet in the Xiang Hu system, the Elf King Vali looked at a pile of data in his hands and couldn't help but scratch his head and mutter, "Something's not right! According to this set of data, there shouldn't be any problems, but why do errors keep occurring during the experiment?"</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the Beastman King Black Gill was also puzzled, "That's right, we've each verified it five times and there were no problems, but it doesn't match the experimental results. There must be an issue. Could we have chosen the wrong materials?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Winged King Quan Fugui suggested, "Why don't we ask the Sea King Yuan Shu? He's the most talented with the strongest learning ability among all of us. If we let him take a look, he'll definitely be able to see where the problem lies."</p><p></p><p>The Beastman King Black Gill appeared very hesitant, glancing at the Elf King Vali.</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vali's expression became very unpleasant, "That guy is indeed talented, but he's too arrogant. He always has that lonely and aloof look. Who can stand him?"</p><p></p><p>The Winged King Quan Fugui said nonchalantly, "Ai~ Now that we're facing the final test, what's the point of caring about these things? The key is to successfully solve the problem and complete the experiment. To be honest, if I can become the teacher's true disciple, I'd be willing to wash the Sea King Yuan Shu's feet."</p><p></p><p>The Beastman King Black Gill immediately nodded, "Me too."</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vali sighed, "Alright! Let's find the Sea King Yuan Shu to help us take a look. I'm not someone who doesn't know what's important."</p><p></p><p>They didn't consider whether the Sea King Yuan Shu would actually teach them, because although the Sea King was aloof and arrogant, he usually answered all questions and never hid his knowledge.</p><p></p><p>So the three of them brought their data and experimental processes to find the Sea King Yuan Shu.</p><p></p><p>After carefully examining the three's experimental data, the Sea King Yuan Shu thought for a moment, then took out a thick draft book and began calculating.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he put down his pen and pointed to a spot, telling the three, "You missed considering a hidden material factor in this step, causing all subsequent deductions to be wrong. Add a constant here, go back and recalculate, and it should be fine."</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vali and the other two looked at each other, "Just like that?"</p><p></p><p>"Just like that!"</p><p></p><p>After thanking him, the three returned, with the Elf King cursing along the way, "It wasn't that difficult after all... Why could he see the problem with just a calculation, while the three of us couldn't see it no matter what?"</p><p></p><p>The Beastman King Black Gill shook his head, "If I knew, first place would definitely be mine."</p><p></p><p>The Winged King Quan Fugui saw it more openly, "He's a genius, after all! Always different. But the teacher also said that in the end, whether we qualify or not, talent is not the criterion. Although I don't know what the criterion is, as long as we do our best in everything, that's enough. Being able to learn from the teacher for a hundred years and know the vastness and mysteries of the universe, I actually feel content in my heart. No matter the outcome, I can accept it."</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the three returned and restarted the experiment. Two days later, they successfully obtained the results.</p><p></p><p>The data matched the experiment.</p><p></p><p>The three looked at each other and saw the joy in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vali thought about it and resolutely said, "The Sea King Yuan Shu helped us so much, we must thank him in person."</p><p></p><p>He used his remaining points to redeem two bottles of fine elf wine, "Come, let's go drink with Yuan Shu."</p><p></p><p>The Winged King Quan Fugui was surprised, "But doesn't he not drink alcohol?"</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vali directly pulled the other two, "Whether to give it is your business, whether to drink it is his business. Let's go!"</p>

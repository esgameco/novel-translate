        <h1>Chapter 788</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Before taking action, Su Hao was accustomed to setting a general direction and determining his goals.</p><p></p><p>Because once the goal was set, it would allow the things he did next to be more directional, without having to worry about going off track halfway through for no reason.</p><p></p><p>This was also the key for him to grow from a weak and helpless little brat to his current level.</p><p></p><p>Effort alone was not enough, the effort had to be in the right direction.</p><p></p><p>He understood that effort was only a basic element of success.</p><p></p><p>After determining the direction, Su Hao began to study the first issue - eternal life.</p><p></p><p>After having a brain that could be constantly renewed and never age, would that lead to eternal life?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao believed that for a person, the most important thing was perhaps not whether their physical body survived, but whether their consciousness and thinking still functioned. As long as the consciousness and thinking remained, that person was still alive.</p><p></p><p>On this point, his view differed from most people's.</p><p></p><p>To give a simple example: In the story of The Ghouls, was Nie Xiaoqian dead? According to most people's view, she was dead. But in Su Hao's view, she was not dead. The reason was that she still had consciousness, could still think, and could even fall in love...she had just changed her form of life.</p><p></p><p>True death was the cessation of thinking, becoming nothingness.</p><p></p><p>So, as long as Su Hao could continue thinking with his spiritual brain, then he would remain alive - an eternal life.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's consciousness returned to his main body, and he walked out of the nutrient pod. With a casual snap of his fingers, the special nutrient liquid on his body instantly disappeared. A simple, comfortable shirt automatically generated around him. His long beard was cut off cleanly at the roots. A light breeze blew by, and his messy hair swayed as if he had just received a full wash, cut and blow-dry service at a high-end hair salon, leaving him looking neat and refreshed.</p><p></p><p>When his knowledge reached a certain level, Su Hao demonstrated abilities that rivaled an omnipotent deity when dealing with small matters of life.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even deities could not act as smoothly as he did?</p><p></p><p>"It's probably been over fifty years since I last returned to my main body. Regardless, it's still more comfortable and natural to use my own body.</p><p></p><p>And after not using my main body for so long, I can feel that my physical form has degraded somewhat. It's just unknown when I'll be able to find a way to resolve the wave issue."</p><p></p><p>After adapting for a while, he walked slowly to a pavilion and sat leisurely at the stone table.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a glass cylinder filled with tubes appeared on the stone table. Inside the glass cylinder, soaked in a faint golden glow, was a ball about the size of a fist. Various thin tubes were inserted into it, connecting to the apparatus of the glass cylinder.</p><p></p><p>This ball was the 'spiritual brain' that Su Hao had created six thousand years ago. Its function was the same as an ordinary brain, or even superior, but its internal structure was vastly different.</p><p></p><p>After all, one was a neural brain of flesh and blood that used electronic signal transmission, while the other was a spiritual brain modeled after the neural structure of the mother insect, using 'spiritual particles' for signal transmission.</p><p></p><p>In order to test the performance and battery life of the spiritual brain, Su Hao had carefully preserved this spiritual brain for six thousand years.</p><p></p><p>And now, on the surface, this brain still appeared full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao had expected, as long as it was properly maintained and updated, the spiritual brain could continue to exist.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the consciousness information that Su Hao had input for testing had already collapsed beyond recovery more than three thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>As for why it collapsed...</p><p></p><p>Simply put, in the virtual world that Su Hao had constructed for it to live in, that consciousness first became self-doubting and depressed, then struggled and became extreme, mentally abnormal and deranged, and finally, its consciousness collapsed and completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Now, within this spiritual brain, only a large amount of fragmented information remained from that consciousness, and these fragments were gradually collapsing into disordered particles as time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the 'Truman Show world' that Su Hao had built was still not perfect enough, allowing that intelligent consciousness to detect clues. After countless years of fruitless struggle, it chose self-destruction.</p><p></p><p>After that, Su Hao did not conduct similar experiments again.</p><p></p><p>The entire process of that consciousness, from its initial revival to its ultimate destruction, was witnessed by Su Hao. Its countless struggles, and finally its despair and collapse, undoubtedly left a profound impression on his heart and mind.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao did not want to continue such long-term experiments before he had the ability to create a flawless 'Truman Show world'.</p><p></p><p>Even if he did conduct experiments, he would only do short-term ones, no more than two hundred years, giving each experimental consciousness a quiet termination.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took out the spiritual brain and performed a comprehensive inspection on it, setting it to an 'initialized' state, also known as factory settings.</p><p></p><p>Then he returned to the laboratory to prepare for the upcoming experiments.</p><p></p><p>The battery life of the spiritual brain had been tested and was no longer an issue.</p><p></p><p>Next, he needed to test whether the spiritual brain could exhibit various abilities like the human brain - the three most important being learning ability, thinking ability, and spiritual ability.</p><p></p><p>Lacking any one of these three would mean it was not perfect in Su Hao's view.</p><p></p><p>From the previous consciousness test, learning ability and thinking ability were not lacking, but there was still no detailed data on the multi-dimensional spiritual ability.</p><p></p><p>So this time, Su Hao wanted to focus on testing whether the spiritual brain could allow a consciousness to develop multi-dimensional spiritual abilities.</p><p></p><p>Such as his blood vigor consciousness, spatial spiritual tentacles, divine thoughts, and primordial spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>These spiritual abilities were extremely crucial tools for Su Hao to 'influence the world with consciousness', their importance was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>In other words, without these spiritual abilities, he could not even update the spiritual brain, let alone discuss eternal life.</p><p></p><p>After preparing the plan and setup in the laboratory, Su Hao controlled a separate body to go out and easily bring back the consciousness information of a few criminals.</p><p></p><p>Then, using himself as a bridge, he carefully transmitted one of the consciousness streams into the spiritual brain. At the same time, the sealed consciousness's 'isolation chamber' program started running, building a vast virtual world centered on that consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Various scenery settings were constructed, all kinds of simulated characters were imported, and scene after scene of scripts were prepared...</p><p></p><p>Where the consciousness would awaken, who it would encounter, what experiences it would go through, what gains it would obtain - everything was roughly arranged.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, it would be guided onto the path of spiritual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself, "Just need to wait a period of time to see if the spiritual brain is capable of multi-dimensional spiritual attributes."</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time passed, a consciousness originating from the Cloud Ring System of humans gradually awoke.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Niu Yingzi, but everyone likes to call me Niu Zi. I killed all those bastards who bullied my sister, killed them brutally. From their faces, I saw their regretful expressions - it was so delightful, haha!</p><p></p><p>Apparently, I was sentenced to death, but it doesn't matter. I was already sick of this boring, despairing world.</p><p></p><p>What I didn't expect was that before my death, I encountered a surprising person - the Divine Lord Xu Shiqiang!</p><p></p><p>I absolutely wouldn't mistake him. That person was indeed the Divine Lord Xu Shiqiang. But why did he appear here? Why did he look at me with that inexplicable gaze? So creepy.</p><p></p><p>But it doesn't matter. No matter how powerful Xu Shiqiang is, he can't change the fact that my sister can't come back. Besides, I'll be dead soon anyway...</p><p></p><p>As expected, I died.</p><p></p><p>Shot right through the chest, leaving a huge hole that I could see through to the scenery behind me.</p><p></p><p>I watched helplessly as my life drained away, but I had no regrets.</p><p></p><p>But wait, is this how death row inmates are executed by firing squad? The TV and internet have been lying to me for over 20 years?</p><p></p><p>This world is truly full of deception and falsehoods.</p><p></p><p>Wait! If I'm dead, why can I still think so clearly?"</p><p></p><p>Niu Yingzi suddenly opened his eyes and slowly sat up, looking around at the scene.</p><p></p><p>A mud hut, a tiled roof, farming tools from ancient times piled in one corner, and firewood stacked on the other side.</p><p></p><p>He was lying on the ground covered in woven straw mats.</p><p></p><p>Niu Yingzi immediately looked down at his chest and felt it with his hand.</p><p></p><p>Completely unharmed, he could even feel his beating heart.</p><p></p><p>"This is...where? Wasn't I dead? How did I end up in this strange place? The Cloud Ring System shouldn't have planets this backward."</p><p></p><p>"At least ten thousand years into the past!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...that I've time traveled, like the rumors on the internet?"</p><p></p><p>As Niu Yingzi pondered confusedly, someone pushed open the door from outside, and the sudden bright light caused him to squint instinctively.</p><p></p><p>A delighted voice came from the doorway, "You're awake? That's great! You've been unconscious for three whole days."</p><p></p><p>Niu Yingzi looked carefully and saw it was an exquisite little girl of seven or eight years old, beaming happily at him.</p><p></p><p>Such a warm smile.</p><p></p><p>Just as Niu Yingzi didn't know what to say, the little girl turned and ran out, calling back, "You must be hungry! I'll have my dad get you something to eat. Oh, if you need the bathroom, the outhouse is outside!"</p><p></p><p>Niu Yingzi immediately felt a bloated sensation in his lower abdomen and his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, I can't hold it anymore!"</p>

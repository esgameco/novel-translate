        <h1>Chapter 796</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Dragon seemed to notice something and turned his head to see that the small, weak little one was actually stepping on him.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, wouldn't that be the same as him submitting to the little one?</p><p></p><p>"Arrroooo--"</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Dragon immediately struggled instinctively, wanting to get up and knock down the little one.</p><p></p><p>How could Suhao allow that? Circulating the small amount of refined blood energy within his body, he firmly stepped down.</p><p></p><p>"Bam!"</p><p></p><p>"Oww!" Big Brother Dragon let out a pained howl as the forceful stomp pushed his partially raised body back down to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, even when Suhao was still an egg, he had begun refining his blood energy. Now he had accumulated some, and by circulating it, he could instantly unleash greater strength.</p><p></p><p>Though Big Brother Dragon was only born a few days earlier than Suhao, his body had developed extraordinarily sturdy and powerful.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his thick scaly hide made him appear to have no obvious vulnerable spots. Without blood energy, Suhao may not have been able to hurt him.</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Dragon still wanted to keep trying to get up.</p><p></p><p>Suhao raised his paw and stomped down again.</p><p></p><p>"I stomp! Stomp stomp stomp..."</p><p></p><p>He stomped the mighty Big Brother Dragon until he howled.</p><p></p><p>Sister Dragon's eyes shone as she couldn't help but move closer, imitating Suhao's movements and kicking out her paw to fiercely kick Big Brother Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Sister Dragon couldn't help but let out a howl too, probably wanting to say "Awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Then she joined Suhao in happily beating up Big Brother Dragon, who had probably bullied her a lot over the past couple days.</p><p></p><p>With their combined efforts, Big Brother Dragon had no ability to fight back. Though Sister Dragon and Suhao were a bit weaker than him in strength, they weren't that much weaker.</p><p></p><p>His sturdy body couldn't let Big Brother Dragon ignore the beating from the two young dragons.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Big Brother Dragon's cries changed to whimpers, indicating he had submitted to Suhao's beating.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's paws were getting a bit sore from all the kicking, so he stopped.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Sister Dragon stopped too, her childish face full of excitement. But it seemed she wasn't fully satisfied yet, so she tilted her head thinking, then gave one more fierce kick.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three young dragons stop playing, the giant dragon let out another strange string of sounds from its throat. It then lowered itself, grabbed Suhao's tail with its claw, and lifted him up, turning to walk out of the hatching chamber.</p><p></p><p>Throughout, Suhao offered no resistance, allowing the giant dragon to do as it wished.</p><p></p><p>After passing through two stone chambers, the giant dragon brought Suhao to the cave entrance, which was very flat and spacious, with a towering cliff outside.</p><p></p><p>Just as Suhao was wondering if the giant dragon intended to throw him off the cliff for some kind of "baptism after hatching" ritual, it set him down with its claw and turned to retrieve a wild boar from the corner, casually tossing it aside.</p><p></p><p>Judging by the boar's stiff, motionless body lying on the ground, if not for the steady rising and falling of its chest, Suhao would have thought it was a dead pig.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the boar, Suhao instinctively swallowed. "This boar looks pretty good!"</p><p></p><p>Even as an egg, he had started refining his blood energy to increase his self-preservation abilities.</p><p></p><p>He had refined the blood energy, but his body had expended tremendous energy doing so with no additional replenishment until now. At this moment, his belly was ravenously hungry.</p><p></p><p>Just from beating up Big Brother Dragon earlier, he had almost exhausted himself.</p><p></p><p>"This boar must be food for me to eat. I can eat it raw to fill up and regain energy..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Suhao took a few steps with his hind legs, his wings slightly spread to maintain balance, and scurried towards the boar.</p><p></p><p>But after just a few steps, the giant dragon extended a claw to grab and lift him, putting him back in his original spot.</p><p></p><p>Suhao was slightly puzzled. "Not for me? What a pity."</p><p></p><p>As he was thinking this, the giant dragon took a deep breath and suddenly breathed out towards the boar.</p><p></p><p>"Fwoosh!"</p><p></p><p>A scorching red blaze of flames spewed from the giant dragon's mouth, engulfing the boar.</p><p></p><p>"Aaannnggg--"</p><p></p><p>The boar's shrill scream came from within the flames.</p><p></p><p>Suhao vaguely saw the boar suddenly leap up and run around frantically within the flames, unable to escape their range, before finally collapsing silent after a moment.</p><p></p><p>The aroma of roasted meat quickly wafted through the cave.</p><p></p><p>The three young dragons couldn't help swallowing hard.</p><p></p><p>Suhao was quite surprised in his heart. "This giant dragon can actually breathe fire! Impressive! More importantly, it roasted the meat before eating it, how sophisticated."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the giant dragon placed the sizzling roasted boar meat in front of Suhao. It then turned and went to lie down in a corner, quietly observing the three young dragons.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't mind the heat and immediately tore off a leg, taking a big bite and chewing noisily.</p><p></p><p>"So delicious!"</p><p></p><p>"Gurgle!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suhao eating so happily, Big Brother Dragon and Sister Dragon couldn't resist inching closer, extending their claws wanting to grab some boar meat too.</p><p></p><p>Suhao glared at them. "This roasted boar was specially prepared by the giant dragon for my growth after hatching - it's the key for me to rapidly grow. There may not even be enough for just me, yet these two idiots actually want a piece?"</p><p></p><p>Plus, he knew the giant dragon must have prepared a roasted meal for each of them when they hatched earlier. Otherwise, there's no way they could have grown so big in just a few days. After eating their own portions, how dare they try to take Suhao's share?</p><p></p><p>But for Suhao, it was different.</p><p></p><p>This boar belonged solely to him.</p><p></p><p>Suhao quickly gulped down the leg in his mouth, then jumped up and batted away the claws they had extended. He let out two threatening roars at them.</p><p></p><p>"Roarrr--"</p><p></p><p>Full of dominance.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons, intimidated by Suhao's earlier beating, actually retreated two steps in trepidation, not daring to approach.</p><p></p><p>Suhao swallowed the meat in his mouth, then tore off another fragrant roasted leg, waving it menacingly at the two before stuffing it into his mouth and noisily chewing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the two young dragons couldn't stand it, drooling waterfalls.</p><p></p><p>And the more Big Brother Dragon watched, the more indignant he felt. How could this scrawny little one be stuffing his face while a powerful, mighty dragon like himself could only watch helplessly?</p><p></p><p>Thoughts unconsciously arose in his mind again, as if he had already forgotten being pinned down and beaten earlier. He quietly circled around behind Suhao, intending to launch a sneak attack.</p><p></p><p>This time, he was confident he could knock down the little one.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's eyes followed Big Brother Dragon's movements. Seeing him sneaking up, Suhao knew exactly what he intended.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like this guy doesn't learn from getting beaten!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao quickly finished the meat in his mouth in a few bites. Then with a push of his legs, he shot forward. Before Big Brother Dragon could react, he rammed his two slightly protruding horn buds into Big Brother Dragon's chin.</p><p></p><p>"Bam!"</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Dragon's upper and lower jaws clamped together forcefully, his head flung up as his strong hind legs lost balance and he tumbled over onto his back.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't let up, raising his strongest hind leg to stomp down on him.</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Dragon's hide was tough - Suhao wasn't worried about seriously injuring him.</p><p></p><p>"Owwwww~"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the sounds of Big Brother Dragon's submission could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Sister Dragon instinctively retreated a couple steps.</p><p></p><p>Suhao pulled back his leg and leisurely returned to the roasted boar to enjoy his meal.</p><p></p><p>The giant dragon lying in the corner watched the whole scene, an expression of surprise emerging, before its mouth corners lifted in what seemed like...a smile? Baring its fierce teeth.</p><p></p><p>Though this young dragon's body didn't look very big, after devouring an entire roasted boar, Suhao still felt unsatisfied. He unconsciously looked towards the giant dragon, wondering if there was any more...</p><p></p><p>The giant dragon responded with a ferocious grin, seeming very satisfied with Suhao's performance today.</p><p></p><p>Suhao gave up with resignation. "Nevermind, we can't communicate yet. I'll develop slowly - this new life is already off to a much better start than before."</p><p></p><p>After Suhao finished eating, the giant dragon carried away the remaining bones and scraps, leaping out of the spacious cave entrance to fly away.</p><p></p><p>The three young dragons waddled to the entrance and watched the giant dragon's figure grow smaller until disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>Suhao took this chance to observe their current environment - they were inside a wide crevice on a sheer cliff face. From the outside, it would be extremely difficult to notice this giant dragon's nest tucked into the cliff side crevice - it was quite concealed.</p><p></p><p>Suhao stuck his head out and looked down, estimating they were over a thousand meters up.</p><p></p><p>This discovery gave him some relief - such a hidden location meant they likely wouldn't encounter any danger for a while.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he pulled his head back in and returned to the hatching chamber, which was lined with soft downy bedding perfect for digesting food and circulating blood energy.</p><p></p><p>"Arrooooo--"</p><p></p><p>But it seemed Big Brother Dragon had already forgotten the unpleasantness of being beaten, actively approaching Suhao wanting to play and roughhouse, with Sister Dragon tagging along, raring to join in.</p><p></p><p>Suhao kicked them away.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost! Go play by yourselves!"</p>

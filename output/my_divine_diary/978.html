        <h1>Chapter 978</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the laboratory, Su Hao controlled one of his [Divine] avatars, opening its eyes. He raised his right hand, and a glowing white sphere of light formed in his palm, its soft radiance illuminating his smiling face.</p><p></p><p>This sphere of white light was precisely the yuan ling (elemental spirit) he had envisioned.</p><p></p><p>After another half year of experimentation, he had successfully infused yuan qi (elemental energy) into the ling in a gentle way, allowing the ling to retain its original properties while also taking on the attributes of yuan qi.</p><p></p><p>Now his [Divine] avatar had transformed from its original "ling body" into the current "yuan ling body".</p><p></p><p>The explosive power of spells released using yuan ling increased by one level, achieving a true qualitative transformation.</p><p></p><p>Compared to ordinary spells, yuan ling spells had as vast a difference as celestial spells compared to ordinary ones.</p><p></p><p>The "Destruction Cannon" spell he previously released at full power using "energy packing techniques" could directly blast a huge crater into a planet, destroying its ecosystem.</p><p></p><p>Now, releasing the "Destruction Cannon" at full yuan ling power might be able to blast off an entire corner of a planet, making it look like an "apple".</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his instantaneous explosive power had increased by another level.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he was not far from being able to pulverize a planet with a single blast.</p><p></p><p>However, based on his current strength, unless he used an unlimited source conversion array to stack a vast quantity of yuan ling, he still could not pulverize a planet.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao was full of hope for the future. As long as he continued exploring the universe, he believed he would encounter more unknown things that would allow yuan ling to further evolve into higher forms of energy.</p><p></p><p>However, what delighted Su Hao most was not the increase in yuan ling's power level, but rather the changes to his physical body.</p><p></p><p>A body infused with yuan ling had almost become an indestructible adamantine physique. Combined with his fragile armor defense, Su Hao could not think of any opponent capable of breaking through his defenses for now.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he called the yuan ling body the "golden body", indicating that at this level of physical power, it would be very difficult to damage through brute force.</p><p></p><p>Up until this point, Su Hao's research on "yuan qi" was about to enter a new phase - the application phase.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the golden body, Su Hao believed yuan qi possessed even more powerful applications. But how to fully unleash yuan qi's properties and integrate them into his own power system might require an extremely long period of development.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao had another choice - to introduce yuan qi as one of the myriad power systems into the Infinite Lands, allowing all the races there to jointly explore its applications.</p><p></p><p>This would undoubtedly accelerate the development of yuan qi's practical uses.</p><p></p><p>As for the specifics of how to do this, Su Hao did not yet have a clear plan.</p><p></p><p>For now, there was one thing he needed to do.</p><p></p><p>"I should explore this martial world to find out where exactly this yuan qi originated from - whether it is a unique material of this planet or present throughout this entire star system. First, I need to confirm the source of yuan qi's genesis."</p><p></p><p>The confirmation method was simple - he just needed to wander around this star system. If no other planets besides the martial world had yuan qi, then he could pinpoint its origin on the martial planet itself. But if other planets in the system also had yuan qi, then it meant yuan qi came from outside the martial planet.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao immediately flashed into the outer space of the martial planet and used the "Stellar Network" to teleport to another planet, closing his eyes to sense its aura.</p><p></p><p>"There's yuan qi! I can sense a rich concentration of yuan qi on this planet too. This is getting interesting - perhaps all the planets in this star system have yuan qi."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then transmitted himself to several more planets in succession.</p><p></p><p>He sensed yuan qi on each one, without exception.</p><p></p><p>"Then where does yuan qi originate from?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao kept jumping between planets, sensing the concentration of yuan qi, calculating its distribution patterns, and then simulating a trend map of its distribution in the Ballworld Space.</p><p></p><p>Finally, from the trend map, he concluded that the yuan qi concentration was highest at the center of the star system.</p><p></p><p>Inexplicably, Su Hao recalled the scene from before in the Yunhuan System's central black hole, where he saw massive energy blocks being spewed out from the black hole.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "Could it be that yuan qi is also ejected from the black hole?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the thought crossed his mind, he transmitted to the nearest planet he could reach from the black hole, then activated "Starlight Cruise" to fly towards the black hole's direction.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to approach the black hole himself and see if it was as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>However, this distance was extremely vast. Even using Starlight Cruise, it would take him several years to travel to that specific location.</p><p></p><p>So after activating Starlight Cruise, Su Hao chose to go into idle mode, returning his main consciousness to the Ballworld Space to control another [Divine] avatar to take action.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang......"</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao walked out of the lab, he saw Lv Yijiang and the others feverishly sparring, honing their martial skills.</p><p></p><p>They dared not slack off in their martial cultivation, especially with the looming presence of An Mingwang, whom they were waiting to defeat.</p><p></p><p>Ever since cultivating using the methods taught by Su Hao, the three of them had seen their martial cultivation soaring, making obvious progress every day, which made An Mingwang's eyelids twitch in agitation.</p><p></p><p>If Lv Yijiang and the other two continued progressing at this rate, An Mingwang estimated that in some time, he might as well just run away upon seeing them.</p><p></p><p>An Mingwang felt rather resentful. Why did Jia Wei teach those three but not him?</p><p></p><p>But the arrogant An Mingwang found it hard to swallow his pride and ask someone for guidance.</p><p></p><p>Who was he? He was the world's strongest martial artist, an unmatched existence destined to rule the world.</p><p></p><p>So he could only stand by, looking on with a sour expression from head to toe, emanating an aura of "displeasure".</p><p></p><p>Of course, he did not forget his daily cultivation either. But no matter how hard he tried, he could no longer make any further progress.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Su Hao come out, Lv Yijiang and the other two immediately stopped sparring and respectfully greeted him: "Master Jia Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Initially, the three did not treat Su Hao with such deference, as "power" alone was not a reason for them to respect someone. But later, after making tremendous progress under Su Hao's guidance, their attitudes gradually changed.</p><p></p><p>What they did not know was that when facing Su Hao, their respect was tinged with a hint of fear. They subconsciously regarded Master Jia Wei as an undefeatable existence.</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his divine consciousness, Su Hao immediately took in the three's situation. Apart from a significant increase in their yuan qi, they had also developed a new power - ling force.</p><p></p><p>Although small, they had successfully cultivated spiritual power and fused it with yuan qi.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Your cultivation is progressing smoothly. From now on, you only need to follow the instructions from the learning machine. Once you reach the Yuan Embryo realm, you will naturally gain over a thousand years of longevity."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang and the other two showed delighted expressions, expressing their gratitude to Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang asked, "Master Jia Wei, at our current pace, how long will it take for us to reach the Yuan Embryo realm?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao replied, "Quickly, twenty years. Slowly, a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi exclaimed in shock, "But if it's slow, wouldn't we die of old age before reaching the Yuan Embryo realm?"</p><p></p><p>They did not think they could live another hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "No, after reaching the Foundation Establishment realm, your longevity will increase to some extent. Living another hundred years won't be an issue - provided, of course, that you don't expend too much of your life force."</p><p></p><p>The three nodded in understanding.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Since our cultivation has concluded, I shall send you all out."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, An Mingwang immediately jumped up, looking at Su Hao with delight. "Cultivation is over...we can go out?"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang and the other two also looked surprised.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, if possible, they wanted to stay and cultivate here a while longer, because Master Jia Wei's guidance often allowed them to gain profound insights and develop new understandings of nature.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang suddenly asked, "Master Jia Wei, I have a question for you."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Ask."</p><p></p><p>"I once heard Mr. Cong Renfei mention that he came from the Infinite Lands. I want to ask, where are the Infinite Lands located? After defeating An Mingwang, I plan to go to the Infinite Lands to explore and cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Beside them, An Mingwang immediately flew into a rage, eyes spitting fire. This brat actually dared to brazenly claim he would defeat him! He inwardly decided that after going out, he must give these three a brutal beating to vent his anger.</p><p></p><p>"Without anyone's help, you three aren't even worth me lifting a finger against."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng also looked at Su Hao expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "It's simple. After some time, I'll have the engineering team come build you all a world passage here."</p>

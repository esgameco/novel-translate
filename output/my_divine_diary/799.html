        <h1>Chapter 799</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>This was a range of undulating mountains, called the Clouds Mountains. </p><p></p><p>To the south of the mountain range was a vast and boundless huge prairie, called the Paradise Prairie.</p><p></p><p>The prairie was rich in species, with massive herds of sheep, cattle, horses, elephants, deer, and beasts of all kinds.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also quite a few predatory animals making a living here.</p><p></p><p>Among these predatory animals of various kinds, excluding humans, the dragon race was the strongest.</p><p></p><p>When many dragons were hungry, they liked to come to the Paradise Prairie to hunt and kill various animals to fill their bellies.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's den where Suhao was located was in the Clouds Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Most of the food brought back by the mother dragon for the three young dragons was hunted from the Paradise Prairie.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how carefully the mother dragon avoided human sight and changed hunting locations, bringing prey back to the nest stealthily, her tracks were still discovered by humans.</p><p></p><p>The reason was probably because Suhao ate too much, causing the mother dragon to leave heavier traces each time she went out hunting...</p><p></p><p>At the junction of the Clouds Mountains and Paradise Prairie, there was a hidden cave where more than a dozen well-dressed humans, both men and women, had gathered.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the spacious cave was a large table, with only three people sitting beside it - two middle-aged men and a voluptuous woman.</p><p></p><p>The rest were mostly waiting in various corners, either daydreaming, meditating, chatting softly, or cleaning various weapons like giant crossbows, hooks, chains, and spiked maces...</p><p></p><p>A few round gems were embedded in the arched ceiling of the cave, shedding bright white light onto the map on the table.</p><p></p><p>The woman sitting at the table had bright features and a very handsome face. With a faint smile at the corners of her mouth, she looked utterly charming.</p><p></p><p>She flicked her slightly curled high ponytail and smiled faintly, "This huge red-gold dragon that we've been watching for half a year has been acting a bit abnormally recently. Based on the information from various locations in the Paradise Prairie, I'd say there's an 80-90% chance it's feeding newly hatched red-gold dragon cubs."</p><p></p><p>As she said this, she smiled and held up six fingers, "Based on the amount of food the red-gold dragon has brought back, there must be at least five red-gold cubs. Note that it's the minimum - there could be six."</p><p></p><p>The bearded middle-aged man next to her laughed heartily, "Yavey's estimates are naturally 'about 90% accurate'! After four months, it seems our 'Gold Wealth Squad' is going to make another haul. If there really are five red-gold cubs as you say, then we won't have to work for the next two years and can indulge in enjoying life!"</p><p></p><p>The other middle-aged man with white curly hair looked excited, "These are red-gold cubs! If we can capture them, there will definitely be a horde of soul mages willing to spend fortunes to buy them. This trip will definitely be a huge windfall.</p><p></p><p>But Xibo, with the way you spend lavishly, no amount of money would be enough for you to last two years. Half a year would be more than enough for you to squander it all! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Xibo grinned, revealing a mouthful of gold teeth through his thick beard, "Geya, you're not much better than me."</p><p></p><p>He turned to the voluptuous Yavey, "Yavey is a soul mage herself, why don't you ask her if she wants to buy one?"</p><p></p><p>Yavey leaned close to Xibo and rubbed his arm playfully, "Of course I'll reserve one. Xibo, you wouldn't be so unkind as to not sell me one at a low price, would you?"</p><p></p><p>Xibo threw his head back and roared with laughter, giving Yavey's butt a hard slap, "What are you saying? Hasn't our 'Gold Wealth Squad' already set the rule? It's just business, no feelings involved! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Yavey's expression changed abruptly, "If it's just about money, then why did you slap my butt? Taking liberties with me?"</p><p></p><p>Xibo immediately backed away with his hands up, "No, no, no, it was just a habit, sorry, sorry. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>He cleared his throat and his gaze returned to the map, "Let's talk business. The red-gold cubs aren't in hand yet, so it's too early to discuss that. Let's pinpoint the range of the dragon's nest first! The sooner we locate the nest, the less uncertainty there will be if we drag this out."</p><p></p><p>Yavey smiled and drew a circle in the air with her index finger, which lit up with a red glow. She pointed at the map, drawing one circle after another, causing small red circles to appear on the map.</p><p></p><p>"These circles I'm drawing are the locations where this red-gold dragon has been hunting. It's very clever, changing hunting spots, but it doesn't know that we've set up over a hundred observation points across the entire Paradise Prairie to monitor the movements of large herds. It's precisely because of its cleverness that it caught our attention.</p><p></p><p>Then when I observed it, I immediately noticed that the amount of food it was bringing back exceeded its own needs."</p><p></p><p>Yavey's finger moved, drawing red lines on the map to indicate the dragon's return routes. She said slowly, "It also doesn't know that we can track the scent of wild animals, though the scent dissipates too quickly to track very far. But by analyzing multiple routes together, we can still determine the general area of the dragon's nest..."</p><p></p><p>Finally, Yavey circled an area in the Clouds Mountains, "I'm 80-90% sure it's here!"</p><p></p><p>With a casual flick, the red dot at her fingertip vanished. She stared intently at the circled area and said softly, "Heavenly Cliff!"</p><p></p><p>The bearded Xibo and white-haired Geya looked at each other and roared with laughter, as if the five red-gold cubs were already in the bag.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the mother dragon and her three young cubs were unaware that they had been targeted.</p><p></p><p>The family of four was gathered for their first family meeting.</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon made a series of rhythmic sounds from her throat. But to Suhao's ears, it became a very clear speech: "Listen up, you three little ones. My name is Shaduo Oakes, I'm your mother, a great red-gold dragon - one of the strongest races in the world!</p><p></p><p>Your father's name is Muti Sak, and he's currently in the distant Dragon Continent. When you grow up a bit more, I'll take you back to the Dragon Continent to find your father."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Eldest and Dragon Second Sister had received language information implants, but they still needed a long period of learning and interaction to rearrange the implanted information into knowledge they could understand.</p><p></p><p>For now, they could only hear Shaduo's words clearly, but didn't have much concept of the specific meanings of many words.</p><p></p><p>They just tilted their heads curiously at their mother Shaduo. Dragon Eldest blinked and tried to imitate Shaduo's pronunciation, "Shaduo? Mother? Strongest race?"</p><p></p><p>After Shaduo gave a simple explanation, she continued, "When you grow up a bit more, you'll naturally understand. Now, let me officially name you all."</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo extended a claw and tapped Dragon Eldest's forehead, "From now on, your name will be Chipu Sak. You're my first child."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Eldest Chipu understood this time and repeated, "Chipu Sak. First child?"</p><p></p><p>Then a claw tapped Dragon Second Sister's forehead, "Your name is Moli Sak. You're my second child."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Second Sister Moli blinked her eyes happily and followed Shaduo's voice, "Moli Sak."</p><p></p><p>Then she tapped Suhao's forehead, "You're my third child, your name is Leian Oakes!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't care what he was called. He was just curious and asked, "Mother Shaduo, why do I have the surname Oakes, while Chipu and Moli have the surname Sak?"</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo's eyes widened in surprise as she stared at Suhao, "You've mastered the language so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao blinked, "Is it difficult? I could understand what you were saying as soon as I woke up."</p><p></p><p>Shaduo said in disbelief, "Generally, after undergoing the 'Language Soul' baptism, it takes at least half a year to basically grasp the meaning of the language. It's almost impossible to master it the very next day."</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked in return, "Then Mother Shaduo, why did I master the language so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo: "..."</p><p></p><p>She had always known her third child was very intelligent, but she didn't expect him to be this intelligent. If she didn't know that dragon eggs couldn't undergo the evil soul mages' 'Soul Rebirth' ritual, she would have thought her third child's body had been invaded and possessed by another being.</p><p></p><p>Shaduo tried to recall Leian's behavior since hatching and thought to herself, "My third child Leian has always been extraordinarily powerful and wise since birth. During this period, soul mages would not have had the opportunity to find my nest and perform the 'Soul Rebirth' ritual. Most importantly, the timing doesn't add up."</p><p></p><p>She looked at Suhao and thought, "He is indeed my child, there's no mistake about that. Perhaps he is the legendary variant gold dragon said to be born once every ten thousand years, which would explain why he is so exceptionally intelligent..."</p><p></p><p>Having convinced herself, Shaduo set aside her doubts and answered Suhao's question, "It's a dragon tradition that the youngest child can take the mother's surname. Since I saw that you, Leian, were born exceptionally intelligent and powerful, and you resemble me a lot as my youngest child, I took it upon myself to have you take my surname."</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The reason sounded very convincing, but he didn't really agree that he resembled her much.</p><p></p><p>However, it didn't really matter to him.</p><p></p><p>What he was more interested in were the abilities his mother possessed. So he asked, "Mother Shaduo, what is the Language Soul?"</p><p></p><p>Shaduo explained, "This is a special power called soul force. Soul force can manifest various powerful and unique abilities. The 'Language Soul' is not a very difficult soul art. When you grow up and grasp soul force, I can naturally teach you how to use it."</p><p></p><p>Suhao then said, "Actually Mother Shaduo, you don't need to wait for me to grow up. I think you can teach me now. Yes, teach me about soul force first."</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo: "..."</p><p></p><p>She didn't know why, but she couldn't help feeling that her third child was a bit too intelligent.</p><p></p><p>This made her doubt again whether her dragon egg had been tampered with by soul mages.</p><p></p><p>But then she shook her head and dismissed the idea: "Besides the fact that unhatched dragon eggs cannot be used for 'Soul Rebirth', anyone who could undergo Soul Rebirth would know about soul force and the 'Language Soul'. So this has to be my child. He's just a bit strange, but I'll get used to it!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 551</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Huchang City, Hall of the Source Cultivators Association.</p><p></p><p>The originally exquisite and grand Hall of the Source Cultivators Association had now become a pile of ruins.</p><p></p><p>A large crowd of onlookers gawked from afar, pretending to just be passing by.</p><p></p><p>A tall middle-aged man with a small graying ponytail stood before the ruins, his face dark as he demanded, "Who can tell me what exactly happened here?"</p><p></p><p>This man was the president of the Huchang City Source Cultivators Association, holding a position higher than even the mayor. The entire city of Huchang was under his absolute authority.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the unusually suppressed emotions of their president, the people behind him felt a chill, exchanging glances before a bespectacled youth mustered his courage to say, "President Shiceng, the incident happened very suddenly. We are still investigating and will have results soon. Fortunately, the losses were not great..."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged President Shiceng cursed loudly, "Bullshit! Which of your eyes sees 'losses were not great'? The entire hall building has collapsed! And you're telling me losses were not great? What would constitute great losses then? All of you dying inside?"</p><p></p><p>The people behind him fell silent with dread.</p><p></p><p>President Shiceng ranted again, "And this is not just some 'loss' that can be defined by those two words! The reputation of our Huchang City Source Cultivators Association has been ruined! My own face has been ruined! Bastards, how can I hold my head up at the 'Regional Association Conference' next year? Scoundrels!"</p><p></p><p>The bomb dropped by Feng Cheng on Yashan's intentional orders carried extremely powerful force, not only reducing the entire hall building to ruins but also damaging surrounding structures to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>Almost immediately after the explosion, the entire city received the news, making any attempt to cover it up futile.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that when it came to carrying out Old Master Wei's orders, Yashan was extremely meticulous.</p><p></p><p>Anyone or anything obstructing him from completing the tasks assigned by Old Master Wei could enrage him, making him fly into an uncontrollable fury, reverting to how he was when first establishing the 'Silin Society' - grabbing people and slapping them hard a few times at the slightest provocation.</p><p></p><p>There was a period after following Old Master Wei when his temperament became mild, an aftereffect of his frenzied reading, believing the nonsense in books about 'being kind to others', 'resolving issues with wisdom', 'transforming with love', 'chance encounters are destiny, please treat each other well', and so on.</p><p></p><p>But now, after being repeatedly humiliated over the past few days, he saw through the arrogant nature of these people, and his brutality had returned.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Wei was right - many people were impossible to communicate with, and when faced with such people, there was no need to communicate.</p><p></p><p>After calming down a bit, President Shiceng said viciously, "So where are the criminals who bombed our association?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other in silence...</p><p></p><p>Not a single person dared to answer.</p><p></p><p>Even the bespectacled youth fell silent, ignoring the hints from his colleagues.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the bald Demonic Source Cultivator who possessed the 'Undiscriminating' ability muttered, "They escaped!"</p><p></p><p>President Shiceng's eyes bulged with rage, "Escaped? You let them escape?"</p><p></p><p>The bald Demonic Source Cultivator remained relatively calm, "They escaped, rescued by a suddenly appearing Demonic Source Cultivator. It was like an instant teleportation - they just vanished from the spot."</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, not only did the culprits escape, but the Chanqing Factory that you had your nephew take over has also disappeared! I reckon it was the same group behind it."</p><p></p><p>President Shiceng: "???"</p><p></p><p>Then he and his subordinates went to the former Chanqing Factory outside the city. The once noisy and bustling factory was nowhere to be seen - just bare fresh soil.</p><p></p><p>President Shiceng cursed loudly, calling them 'useless' and 'deadweights' among other insults. After venting, he waved his hand, "Put out a bounty! I won't let them set foot anywhere in this world!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about the Chanqing Factory anymore, whether it was a strange disaster or the work of the hall bombers, he would just attribute it all to the hall bombers.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the bald Demonic Source Cultivator hesitated before saying, "Couldn't see their appearance clearly, it was obscured by a huge suit of armor."</p><p></p><p>President Shiceng's anger flared up again. Unable to vent it properly, he cursed some more before ordering, "Then put a bounty on that suit of armor!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>And so, within a short period of time, two crystal suits of armor were listed on the wanted lists of all Source Cultivators Association halls, hung prominently on the walls of the main lobbies.</p><p></p><p>Even the Huaishui Town Source Cultivators Association hall did not miss it, acting with extreme efficiency.</p><p></p><p>These two suits of armor quickly became infamous, dubbed the 'Ground-Scraping Armor' by people who believed they were the armored forms of two Demonic Source Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>When Suhao and Axing Awang were out on a mission together, Suhao's mouth twitched upon hearing Axing mention this, commenting, "What a terrible name - the 'Ground-Scraping Armor'...who came up with that? I hereby declare them the Naming Master!"</p><p></p><p>Axing laughed heartily, "I reckon it was those cultivators whose hall got bombed, just making stuff up in their anger to spite the two in the armor! Hahaha, it's quite amusing."</p><p></p><p>Awang also chuckled, "Nicknames for wanted criminals on the bounty lists are never any good. They're criminals after all, why would anyone bother giving them a cool name? They're basically just trying to insult them as much as possible! But this name isn't too bad in my opinion - the 'Ground-Scraping Armor', hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>Axing said, "If I had a famous nickname that the whole world knew, I wouldn't care if it sounded good or bad."</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "That's easy, I'll make you a bomb later. You can take it and blow up the Source Cultivators Association hall!"</p><p></p><p>"No way, I haven't lived long enough!"</p><p></p><p>The three chatted lightheartedly on their mission, not seeming like they were going on a dangerous disaster relief task, but rather a sightseeing trip.</p><p></p><p>And in reality, it was pretty much equivalent to sightseeing.</p><p></p><p>Most of the disaster relief missions in Huaishui Town were no longer taken seriously by the three of them.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were the team that had resolved two major strange disasters! They were renowned as extremely powerful in the entire town of Huaishui, commanding respect wherever they went.</p><p></p><p>Although their fame was currently limited to just this small town, Axing believed that in the future, their Source Team would become famous throughout the entire Hengxuan region, and even the whole world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their team could now be considered a wealthy one, no longer short on funds. They selectively took on missions at a low frequency, averaging just once a month, living quite comfortably.</p><p></p><p>This also suited Suhao's intentions, as he needed more time to do his own things.</p><p></p><p>So far, the reason he had not left Axing Awang's team was because he recognized Axing's ability to gather intelligence. As long as he remained in Axing Awang's team, he could share all the information Axing collected and stay updated on the happenings of this world.</p><p></p><p>This was extremely important for Suhao, who currently lacked stable channels for obtaining outside information.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would eventually leave the team, it was just a matter of time - perhaps a year, perhaps two!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suhao gradually adapted to the rhythm of this world, steadily progressing according to his set plans.</p><p></p><p>Taking on missions to collect data and learn about disasters;</p><p>Researching and analyzing the properties of the Source from the Source Artifacts he obtained;</p><p>Spending two uninterrupted hours each day cultivating his spiritual power...</p><p></p><p>Advancing towards his goals without slacking.</p><p></p><p>Two years later, 17-year-old Suhao opened his eyes from his cultivation, his pupils brimming with vitality and delight.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Soul Realm!"</p><p></p><p>That familiar yet powerful feeling had returned to him, the surging immense spiritual power within giving him an unparalleled sense of security.</p><p></p><p>This was his previous peak!</p><p></p><p>Of course, Suhao was clear that this was an illusion - he was still far from mastering everything.</p><p></p><p>But what excited him was that through the years of uninterrupted spiritual power cultivation, his current 'Divine Sense' perception range was even greater than his previous world, reaching an astounding 200,000 meter radius.</p><p></p><p>Within this range, mountains, rivers, plants, birds, beasts, insects, fish - whether flying in the sky or lurking underground - nothing could escape his perception.</p><p></p><p>A 200,000 meter radius - he could practically be considered a deity walking the earth!</p><p></p><p>Coupled with his 'Divine Sense' that rendered all things unable to hide, he now had the confidence to face even the strangest and most powerful Source Cultivators of this world!</p><p></p><p>Nothing could stop him from researching the Source unrestrained now. All obstructors would be preemptively eradicated.</p><p></p><p>Suhao stood up and stretched his limbs, a smile growing on his face, "Let me see what exactly this 'Source' is!"</p><p></p><p>The wide range was not his main focus - he was interested in using his Divine Sense to observe the Source itself.</p><p></p><p>In other words, he could now use his Divine Sense to study the Source.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 984</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the lizard people's leader in this region learned about Lv Yijiang and the other two. A smile appeared at the corner of his mouth: "Those three humans must have come out from the desert. They definitely have a world pass on them. Haha, the heavens are helping me too."</p><p></p><p>The lizard leader mustered his troops and sent his capable subordinates to directly surround Lv Yijiang and the other two at the inn, forcibly trying to seize the world pass.</p><p></p><p>For the lizard leader, the world pass he had dreamed of was right in front of him. The actual situation did not allow him to hesitate at all, because hesitating would lead to defeat.</p><p></p><p>'Confidence, courage, wisdom' was the lizard leader's motto, and also the reason he became the regional leader.</p><p></p><p>He would not be cowardly.</p><p></p><p>So the lizard leader hid in the dark, watching helplessly as his subordinates were knocked down one by one by those three strong humans, unable to say a harsh word.</p><p></p><p>The lizard leader retreated quietly, thinking to himself: "Where did these three freakishly strong humans come from? Their strength is definitely above the fourth rank. It's a good thing I had the foresight not to recklessly attack them myself.</p><p></p><p>I'm no match for them, it's better to withdraw...</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity about the world pass. It seems I have no chance to enjoy it alone. However, just because I'm not a match doesn't mean my lizard tribe isn't. Since they've entered our territory, they might as well leave the world pass behind!</p><p></p><p>I don't want much, just one is enough, hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>And so, Lv Yijiang and the other two officially began their journey to break through the infinite lands.</p><p></p><p>"Arghhhh!"</p><p></p><p>"Grrr~"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by frenzied roars, Lv Yijiang's body expanded again, his aura becoming even more powerful. Under the horrified gaze of the lizard tribe's elder, he punched the elder away, turning him into a shooting star disappearing over the horizon.</p><p></p><p>"Who's next?" Lv Yijiang turned around with a furious gaze, his hair standing on end, surrounded by brilliant golden light, as if streaks of lightning were circulating around his body.</p><p></p><p>"The world pass is in my hands, anyone brave enough to come take it?"</p><p></p><p>The might of the battle-crazed warrior terrified the surrounding lizard soldiers, making them all retreat.</p><p></p><p>When Lv Yijiang and the other two left, no one dared stand in their way.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that they realized how precious the lucky goddess's lost coin in their hands truly was.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the lizard world, the three arrived in another new world.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi said, "We can't expose the coin we have, it will attract others' envy."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang raised his fist and laughed, "No, I want to spread the news that I have the coin, I want to fight against all kinds of different warriors. Their martial arts are very interesting, I want to experience them all."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi frowned, "But if we do that, our natural energy won't last long."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang laughed, "It's okay, Cong Renfei said he would come find us soon. Our current natural energy is enough for us to fight for two more years."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng excitedly said, "Let's fight! My blood is boiling."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi sighed, "If that's the case, then let's go!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>So, relying on their formidable strength, the three of them pushed through the infinite lands horizontally, eventually arriving at the central region of the infinite lands - the Xianghu region.</p><p></p><p>By this time, their fame had already spread throughout the various races of the Xianghu region, and they were known as the 'Berserk Three Warriors'.</p><p></p><p>The new demon king Ravier sat at the head of the council of the 28 allied races, looking around at the other 27 racial kings and laughing loudly, "I've received the latest news - the human 'Berserk Three Warriors' have arrived in the Xianghu region and are rampaging through the dwarf tribe's territory. I heard the dwarf king is hiding in his underground palace and dares not come out! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The new earth spirit king also laughed, "For a waste like the dwarves, it's normal for them to cower before the rising fame of the 'Berserk Three Warriors'. If news came that they defeated the Berserk Three, that would be strange. It's said those three berserk warriors have at least the seventh rank of power. Most crucially, their physical strength is extremely powerful - ordinary spells can hardly injure them. It's no surprise they run rampant through the infinite lands."</p><p></p><p>"As the earth spirit king said, they're just strong in physical power. As far as I know, they don't know any spells. The only reason they can run rampant is because they haven't met us yet! Heh, under my magic, they'll be like chickens before a wolf."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, no one has been able to subdue them so far, so they must have some extraordinary ability that requires serious attention."</p><p></p><p>The demon king Ravier laughed, "Those three berserk warriors do indeed have their unique aspects. I'm very interested in their formidable physical strength - perhaps we can find the secret body tempering techniques from them to strengthen our races.</p><p></p><p>And this is precisely why I've invited you kings here. I propose that we 28 kings join forces to capture those three human berserk warriors and interrogate them for the secret of powerful bodies to share together.</p><p></p><p>What do you kings think?"</p><p></p><p>As a peak seventh-rank expert, the demon king Ravier had initially considered trying to capture the three alone to monopolize the secret. However, news soon came from other racial territories that a certain king had been beaten by the three berserk warriors.</p><p></p><p>He had enough self-awareness to assess his own strength and realized he likely couldn't capture the three alone, so he decisively invited the other allied kings to join forces.</p><p></p><p>In his view, with 28 peak seventh-rank kings attacking together, there were no opponents they couldn't defeat.</p><p></p><p>The other racial kings clearly thought the same.</p><p></p><p>After the demon king's proposal, they quickly reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>The 28 kings looked at each other and smiled, their capes fluttering grandly as they stepped out, full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, they surrounded the 'Berserk Three Warriors', confident smiles on their faces as they eyed the three with ill intent.</p><p></p><p>The three stood back-to-back facing the 28 kings, taking up fighting stances.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang shouted loudly, "You're all so strong, have you come to fight us?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi thought inwardly, "The arrivals have ill intentions. These 28 opponents are from different races, and each has a formidable aura - not easy to deal with. It seems the races have allied to deal with us. This time is dangerous."</p><p></p><p>It was the first time facing so many powerful experts at once.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi warned softly, "Yijiang, Taicheng, we need to fight with all our strength this time. Don't be careless."</p><p></p><p>The other two nodded in acknowledgment, crouching slightly and focusing their attention.</p><p></p><p>The demon king heard Lv Yijiang's question and laughed loudly, "We've come to invite you to be our guests. How about it, come with us!"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang said, "Thanks for the kind offer, but no need. I'm only interested in fighting. Want to have a match? If you win, I'll give you my world pass."</p><p></p><p>The kings all laughed loudly, "We don't lack those world pass things. Since you like fighting, then we'll indulge you in a bout. After that, come be our guests - we'll treat you well."</p><p></p><p>The demon king Ravier waved his long spear, instantly imbuing it with various rays of light, "Attack!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he took the lead in attacking the three.</p><p></p><p>The other kings also unleashed various spells towards the three.</p><p></p><p>"Heart-scorching fire spear!"</p><p>"Forbidden body-binding thorns!"</p><p>"Overhead heart-locking sword!"</p><p>"Explosive armor-piercing arrows!" </p><p>"Mountain-splitting great axe!"</p><p>"Lightning-flash binding chains!"</p><p>"Thunderbolt spell!"</p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In an instant, dazzling lights of all colors filled the scene to an explosive degree, even outshining the sunlight for that moment.</p><p></p><p>"Arghhhh!"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang and the other two roared frantically, activating their inner energy. Their bodies abruptly expanded, emanating a berserk aura outwards.</p><p></p><p>The kings' attacks were exceptionally swift, with an immense area of effect, raining down like a torrential storm.</p><p></p><p>Despite being prepared, the three had no time to dodge.</p><p></p><p>So they chose to endure head-on...</p><p></p><p>For them, withstanding the enemy's attacks had already become routine over the many years of fighting. They always did it this way.</p><p></p><p>Because if they split their energy to counterattack while facing the enemy's strikes, their defenses would weaken accordingly, easily exposing openings to be critically injured.</p><p></p><p>So they were accustomed to using all their energy to withstand the enemy's attacks first, then finding an opportunity for a frenzied counterattack.</p><p></p><p>This tactic worked well.</p><p></p><p>One could view martial artists' battles as turn-based in a sense...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 885</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese novel excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao kept sending the consciousness of dimensional travelers, but kept receiving news of their deaths, which left him feeling very helpless.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he came up with a slightly better method: implant an "invincible system" into the dimensional travelers, using a reward and punishment system to constrain their behavior and guide them to become mature individuals.</p><p></p><p>However, with the constant death and replacement of dimensional travelers, Su Hao did not gain much. He found that as the dimensional travelers kept dying, the growth rate of subsequent dimensional traveler attunement slowed down, and the dimensional travelers' survival time in that world was prolonged.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the extended survival time of the dimensional travelers was due to the joint efforts of the eighteen deities, as well as the decline in the intensity of the attunement.</p><p></p><p>This made it hard for Su Hao not to guess that after successfully dealing with the dimensional travelers, the accumulated energy of the ill-fate system had weakened.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the impact they three had caused could be partially offset by other dimensional travelers. As long as there were enough dimensional travelers to share the damage, perhaps the attunement would not accumulate to such a strong degree as to destroy an entire planet.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "If this is true, then the role of these dimensional travelers is not only to assist me in mastering the attunement, but also to reduce the risk to a certain extent. However, there are too few samples now, and more observation and experimentation is needed. It would be best to let the dimensional travelers survive for a longer time."</p><p></p><p>As for how to increase the survival time of dimensional travelers, Su Hao decided to try using the system to bind and assist the dimensional travelers in avoiding potential dangers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao believed that having a system alone might not be enough. A dimensional traveler's ability to successfully grow depended greatly on their personality. Being cowardly, indecisive, lacking in thinking ability, lacking a sense of crisis, and other such traits were major taboos for dimensional travelers.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in addition to creating corresponding systems, he also needed to work on transforming the dimensional travelers' home planet of Blue-Purple Star, quickly advancing its civilization to near-modern levels, popularizing basic knowledge among the humans there, cultivating correct ways of thinking, as well as imparting some survival knowledge for dimensional travelers.</p><p></p><p>This was a two-pronged approach.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A month later, the "Invincible Guidance System" personally created by Su Hao went online.</p><p></p><p>Integrating functions such as reconnaissance, personal attributes, main quests, daily quests, scenario generation quests, lotteries, and an exchange mall, Su Hao found it very useful after testing.</p><p></p><p>He then embedded this "Invincible Guidance System" into the soul network and delegated authority over it to the deities.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said to the deities: "After this period of personal experience, I'm sure you all have a deep understanding of the difficulties in the growth of a world will. I can tell you that this is normal - the growth of a world will is always difficult, but once a world will grows, it will become a great existence, which is worth our efforts.</p><p></p><p>The next generation of the world will is about to be born, and we need to be fully prepared to deal with it. However, in light of previous experiences, I have decided to make some minor adjustments to the measures for protecting the world will."</p><p></p><p>After saying this under the curious gazes of the deities, he opened the "Invincible Guidance System": "This is the guidance plan I have prepared for the world will. We can guide its behavior by issuing it specific tasks. By completing these tasks, it will develop a mature, steady, independent and resilient will. After it completes specific tasks, we will give it small rewards and open up some of the items in the points mall to it, igniting its enthusiasm..."</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao's introduction, the deities felt a wave of dizziness, and quickly realized something was amiss - wasn't this the same method that Lord Lei An had used on them?</p><p></p><p>In other words, Lord Lei An believed that the eighteen deities lacked the ability for independent autonomy, so he issued them tasks to guide them in a specific direction.</p><p></p><p>They, the eighteen deities, had been cultivated by Lord Lei An as if they were foolish world wills...</p><p></p><p>This was an unpleasant association.</p><p></p><p>The Light Bathing God - Yi quickly grasped the key point: "Lord Lei An, do you mean that we can autonomously guide the growth direction of the world will?"</p><p></p><p>His eyes flickered, thinking of the pleasure of being able to issue tasks to others and guide their growth, just like Lord Lei An.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "That's right. After this period of tempering, you have all become qualified 'guidance mentors'. I believe you will definitely be able to complete the guidance task well."</p><p></p><p>With this, the deities became full of confidence in saving the world will.</p><p></p><p>They rallied their spirits and began studying the Invincible Guidance System, each of them rubbing their hands in anticipation of showing off their skills.</p><p></p><p>To the deities, treating this as a nurturing game was actually quite fun.</p><p></p><p>Another month passed, and when the opportunity arose, Su Hao placed the consciousness information of a dimensional traveler who had fallen in battle against mountain bandits into the body of a twelve-year-old boy.</p><p></p><p>Increasing the age was one of Su Hao's new attempts.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had placed the consciousness information into the bodies of five or six-year-old children, intending to give the dimensional travelers enough time to train and adapt to the new environment, so that they would not be overwhelmed by the backlash from making overly large movements at the beginning and be unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>However, after this period of observation, he found that five or six-year-old children had too little mobility. Coupled with the dimensional travelers' lack of awareness to avoid danger, this easily led to an increased risk of danger and death.</p><p></p><p>So he appropriately increased the initial age to collect more data and find a suitable time for dimensional travel.</p><p></p><p>As for why he did not directly implant the consciousness into an adult body, Su Hao believed that having too much mobility from the start, without successfully integrating into the surrounding environment, would be an extremely dangerous thing for the dimensional traveler.</p><p></p><p>About an hour after Su Hao completed sending the consciousness information, a young boy awoke under the expectant gazes of the deities.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"My name is Gu Shuyun. In the battle against the mountain bandits, I unfortunately fell, but miraculously came back to life as a scrawny twelve or thirteen-year-old boy.</p><p></p><p>But I couldn't be happy at all, because I kept thinking about my lover Axin from my previous life.</p><p></p><p>Ever since I became a guard after practicing martial arts, I knew that death would come one day, but I didn't expect it to come so soon.</p><p></p><p>I had clearly made an agreement with my lover Axin that after this mission, I would have earned enough betrothal gift money to marry her. When I returned from this mission, I would marry her properly, and from then on we could live a shameless life together...</p><p></p><p>How fickle life is. If I didn't go on the mission, I wouldn't have money to marry Axin. But if I went on the mission to earn money, I ended up losing my life and still couldn't marry Axin.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Axin was destined not to be mine. Damn it, why wasn't I strong enough? If only I had invincible power..."</p><p></p><p>'Ding dong'!</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a simple blue panel popped up in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Shuyun was stunned for a moment, his curiosity taking over as he instantly put aside his thoughts of Axin and began studying this strange thing.</p><p></p><p>He was certain he had never seen anything like this before. Each glowing dot emanated an unknown scent, constantly stimulating his desire for exploration.</p><p></p><p>He reached out to try touching the panel in front of him, but his hand went right through it, not touching anything.</p><p></p><p>Gu Shuyun muttered, "What is this...?"</p><p></p><p>Just as he voiced his question, the assistant Invincible immediately said, "This is the 'Invincible Assistance System'. As the name implies, it is a tool to assist you in becoming an invincible powerful master. My current purpose is to help you become invincible, defeat the Demon Lord Chipu, and become a world hero. Friendly reminder: you only need to silently voice your thoughts, and I can communicate with you smoothly."</p><p></p><p>Gu Shuyun was half-believing and half-doubting as he tried silently voicing his thoughts: "You mean, with you here, I can possess invincible power?"</p><p></p><p>The assistant Invincible said, "Yes, as long as you complete the growth tasks I have customized for you, you will gain power beyond your imagination."</p><p></p><p>Gu Shuyun immediately became excited: "If I possess invincible power, then wouldn't I have a lot of money and be able to afford enough betrothal gifts to marry as many girls as I want? Wonderful! I feel the sadness of not being able to see Axin again is leaving me. Just you wait, I will definitely gain invincible power and marry as many girls as I can."</p><p></p><p>The deities looked at each other in dismay...</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu Ha Ha laughed, "What an incompetent fellow. With great power, why not have as many beautiful and sturdy female dragons as you want? Such things are merely side benefits of power. When I think back, I used to have a group of female dragons attending to me at all times, it was incredibly pleasurable."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Pillar God Nati also laughed, "I had quite a few top-tier female golden dragon consorts too, it's quite nostalgic to think about."</p><p></p><p>The Beauty Goddess Fuler said unhappily, "I've lost my good impression of this world will, I wish him a smooth survival of one year."</p><p></p><p>Red Light immediately jumped out, "Hey, hey, Fuler, the task is important, don't let your emotions affect your task! Points are more important."</p><p></p><p>The Salvation God Baishen said, "The affairs between men and women come and go in such ways, there's nothing to look forward to. Why not have a hundred girls drain him dry at once, giving him a psychological trauma towards beautiful girls, so he can put his mind on other matters?"</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bali immediately said, "That's not appropriate. Based on my experience, that could be a good ultimate goal to ignite his fighting spirit and courage. Or we could set 'marrying enough girls' as the goal for his first main quest stage."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Bali has great insight."</p><p></p><p>Then Bali began editing the first side quest: "Elderly Neighbor Aili has worked hard cultivating a garden of cabbages, and they are about to be harvested. Unexpectedly, they were cruelly devoured by pests. Aili sits by the vegetable garden crying helplessly. Perhaps the host could lend a youthful and extraordinary perspective to help.</p><p></p><p>Task: Help Aili get rid of the pests and ensure the cabbages are harvested.</p><p>Reward: 10 points.</p><p>Failure punishment: Aili's tears."</p><p></p><p>After editing, Bali said proudly, "What do you think of the quest I edited, fellow lords? Isn't it the work of a genius? Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu bluntly criticized, "Nonsense, who would be enthusiastic about doing such a quest? Watch mine..."</p><p></p><p>"There is a beautiful young girl named Anna who is a neighbor. She is at the age of awakening desires and often secretly watches you, but unfortunately she has to go husk corn every day and has no chance to even greet you.</p><p></p><p>Task: Help Anna husk corn and carry it back to dry at her home.</p><p>Reward: Anna's greeting, 10 points. </p><p>Failure punishment: Anna's disdain, perhaps she will never look at you again from then on."</p><p></p><p>The deities praised, "Lord Gu, brilliant!"</p>

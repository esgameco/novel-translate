        <h1>Chapter 706</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the captain brought in Suhai's niece Yonghua.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she saw Suhai, Yonghua excitedly jumped up and ran towards him, saying in a crisp voice, "Uncle, I finally get to see you!"</p><p></p><p>Suhai put down the semi-transparent crystal 'Seeker Zero' in his hand, took off his gloves, and said indifferently, "Hmm, what do you want from me?"</p><p></p><p>His indifferent voice and indifferent tone were as if he was facing a stranger on the street.</p><p></p><p>Yonghua was taken aback, and the joy of seeing her idol vanished instantly, as if a bucket of ice water had been poured over her head.</p><p></p><p>Since returning to Blue Light, her uncle had never been home, and she thought her uncle had been kidnapped. Little did she expect that he had not been kidnapped, but was simply...heartless?</p><p></p><p>That night at the reunion dinner, everyone was laughing and joking. How did things suddenly change?</p><p></p><p>She looked at the captain, then at Suhai, as if she had realized something. She leaned in close and said in a low voice, "Uncle, are you being coerced? If so, nod slightly, and I'll find a way to rescue you."</p><p></p><p>Suhai said, "Don't overthink it. This is where I want to be. For now, there is no one in this world who can coerce me."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua tried hard to detect any hint of lying on Suhai's face, but unfortunately she couldn't see anything.</p><p></p><p>She hesitated and said, "But Uncle, why haven't you been home for an entire year? Mom and grandparents always talk about missing you. I think you should go back and see them."</p><p></p><p>Suhai said matter-of-factly, "As long as I'm healthy and living happily, whether I go back or not makes no difference. Besides, there's nothing important that requires me to go back for. Reunions always lead to separations, the essence is no different."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua said, "It's not the same!"</p><p></p><p>Suhai shook his head, "If you just came to confirm my situation, then you've seen it now. I'm fine, there's no need to worry. You should all just live your own lives well. Do whatever you want to do, whatever you like!"</p><p></p><p>In Suhai's eyes, human life was too short. Wouldn't it be such a pity if they had to repress their hobbies and interests?</p><p></p><p>Yonghua frowned deeply, "Uncle...tell me the truth, why are you unwilling to go back? Is it...because you dislike us?"</p><p></p><p>Suhai suddenly laughed, "There are things I dislike, but not many, and you're not included. The reason I've stayed here is because I have things I want to do, it's that simple."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua muttered, "Things you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, she asked, "Uncle, can I come visit you often?"</p><p></p><p>Suhai said casually, "Up to you, as long as you don't disturb me."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Yonghua and the captain left, Yashan and Fengcheng came over, curious to ask, "Old Master Wei, who was that little girl? It's rare for her to chat with you for so long."</p><p></p><p>Suhai smiled, "By relation, she's my niece."</p><p></p><p>The two were surprised, "Niece?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng then asked with interest, "Then what relation am I to Old Master Wei? Could I also have sisters or nieces?"</p><p></p><p>Suhai said, "Your relation is that of a death row inmate, human trash."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was dumbstruck, "..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan roared with laughter, patting Fengcheng's shoulder, "Haha, didn't expect that, did you Fengcheng? You were even thinking about having a niece, dreaming too much."</p><p></p><p>Suhai said, "Yashan, you're also a death row inmate."</p><p></p><p>Yashan was also dumbstruck, "..."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng's face turned red from holding back.</p><p></p><p>Suhai smiled and asked, "How is your cultivation going?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Our strength has basically recovered. We're building the 'Mind Platform' and will break through to the Celestial Being realm in at most two months. We're just lacking time to adapt to reach our peak state again."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng also marveled, "This is the first time I've realized how simple cultivating immortality can be. In less than ten days, I went from zero to the Spirit Embryo realm. If other cultivators knew, their eyes would pop out."</p><p></p><p>Suhai said, "It's not that simple. You two had the spiritual foundation for cultivation, so you could regain your powers quickly. For someone starting from zero without any foundation, it would take at least ten years to reach the Spirit Embryo realm.</p><p></p><p>Work hard and break through to the Celestial Being realm soon! After that, I'll start assigning you missions. There are many interesting things in this world."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Old Master Wei!" Yashan and Fengcheng immediately went back to cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Suhai then returned to the lab to continue making the 'Seeker Zero Spirit Eye'.</p><p></p><p>He needed to observe whether Yashan and Fengcheng were locked onto by the 'Stream'.</p><p></p><p>As for the other people or creatures in this world?</p><p></p><p>Just one look and he would quickly know whether only the three of them were special, or if everyone was the same.</p><p></p><p>Two months later, Yashan and Fengcheng successfully broke through to the Celestial Being realm, fully recovering their peak strength.</p><p></p><p>And Suhai had also successfully obtained the 'Seeker Zero Spirit Eye'.</p><p></p><p>After installing the 'Seeker Zero Spirit Eye' into the current 'Eight-Armed God' body he was controlling, that familiar feeling returned.</p><p></p><p>He observed the Stream again.</p><p></p><p>Following where the Stream converged, he found that the end point was connected to Yashan and Fengcheng's bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Just as I thought, Yashan and Fengcheng are also locked onto by the Stream. But what about the others?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Suhai flashed and appeared in the bustling streets of Victory City, observing the situation of the other pedestrians.</p><p></p><p>As Suhai expected, there was no presence of the Stream on the other people.</p><p></p><p>The three of them were special!</p><p></p><p>Then to his delight, apart from the Stream on Yashan and Fengcheng, he didn't find any other abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>Suhai thought to himself, "It seems I really succeeded in breaking free from the Stream's lock. Even this 'Eight-Armed God' body I'm controlling doesn't have any Stream generated."</p><p></p><p>"Next, after resolving Yashan and Fengcheng's Stream lock issue, I'll be able to move freely."</p><p></p><p>Suhai opened his eyes and found himself standing on the sidewalk, surrounded by a group of gawking spectators. Many personal terminal cameras were pointed at him, flashing constantly.</p><p></p><p>There were also noisy exclamations:</p><p></p><p>"Holy crap! Who is this? The superhero Xu Shiqiang? I ran into Xu Shiqiang on the street! I'm the luckiest person of the year, I'm gonna get rich!"</p><p></p><p>"It really is Xu Shiqiang, so tall and handsome! He looks better in person than in photos!"</p><p></p><p>"I love him, didn't waste my time wandering this street today!"</p><p></p><p>"Make way, make way, I want to take a picture with him!"</p><p></p><p>"What's he doing with his eyes closed? Thinking about a problem? As expected of a scientist, such an elegant thinking pose."</p><p></p><p>"Anyone have paper? I want his autograph."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suhai noticed the current situation, but didn't care. He opened his eyes, smiled, and then flashed away disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was dumbstruck: "Where'd he go???"</p><p></p><p>Then the video of Suhai appearing on the street and suddenly disappearing was uploaded online, causing netizens to marvel and speculate that it was the 'Instant Movement' or 'Instant Invisibility' ability.</p><p></p><p>When the human leader Xia Qingjun learned of this, he had a huge headache: "Can't that kid Xu Shiqiang be a bit more low-key? Acting so brazenly, this project will definitely be discovered by the Clairvoyant Race soon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he said: "The official statement will be that it was testing the effects of an 'Invisibility Superpower'."</p><p></p><p>He decided that from then on, whenever an issue arose, he would attribute it to 'superpowers'.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suhai returned to the small world displaying a hundred 'Gods' and transmitted his voice to Yashan and Fengcheng: "Yashan, Fengcheng, teleport to my side now."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Yashan and Fengcheng appeared beside Suhai one after another.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they appeared, they sensed the powerful auras from the hundred 'Gods' displayed in the factory, and curiously looked over, asking: "Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>Suhai said, "This is another small world I created, located beneath Victory City. I called you here mainly to give you new bodies to operate."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were stunned: "New bodies? How?"</p><p></p><p>Then they imagined a scene where Suhai, like an old sorcerer playing with souls, reached out to pull their souls from their bodies, and stuffed them into new bodies, chanting spells...</p><p></p><p>"Rise again! My warriors!"</p><p></p><p>Suhai laughed, "It's like operating a battle mecha. You'll hide and control other bodies to move around. This way, you'll be completely isolated from danger and won't randomly die like in your previous life. Come, let me show you your 'battle mechas'."</p><p></p><p>Then Yashan and Fengcheng saw the 'Eight-Armed Gods' displayed around them.</p><p></p><p>Yashan's spirit trembled as he pointed at the 'Eight-Armed God', incredulous: "Old Master Wei, this is extremely similar to the 'Gods' described in the legends of my Zhu Huo people!"</p><p></p><p>Although the appearance was different, the colors and aura were largely consistent.</p><p></p><p>In his first life, he had challenged the 'Gods' countless times, and had even used his full 'Decay' ability in an attempt to take them down with him.</p><p></p><p>There was no mistaking it.</p><p></p><p>Suhai smiled, "Correct, these are the 'Gods' from the Zhu Huo legends, powerful beings born from the combination of eight sequences. These are the new bodies I've prepared for you. And moreover..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his form gradually changed, pink crystal water gushing out, his body elongating...</p><p></p><p>Finally transforming into an 'Eight-Armed God' identical to the ones displayed.</p><p></p><p>"The body I'm currently controlling is also a 'God'."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were dumbstruck.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1001</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After finding things that could successfully attach to the outside of the ping-pong space, the next plan was very simple.</p><p></p><p>First, constantly find opportunities to produce a semi-condensed state of spiritual power, then attach it to the outside of the ping-pong space, until the quantity reaches a certain level. </p><p></p><p>Then use this semi-condensed spiritual power as a foothold to try carrying other substances.</p><p></p><p>Finally, use the carried substances to create a corresponding physical body.</p><p></p><p>These steps had almost no difficulty for Su Hao, only requiring some time to accumulate enough.</p><p></p><p>The previous difficulty was that there was no foothold outside the surface of the ping-pong space, unable to take away other substances to form a body. Now with the semi-condensed spiritual power that could firmly attach to the surface of the ping-pong space, the issue of the foothold was solved.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was one foothold, Su Hao could use it to build a powerful and complete physical body.</p><p></p><p>The 'Giant Plan' up to now could be said to be largely completed, with no more suspense, just lacking the final testing and wrapping up.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao retrieved the data from testing his spiritual power, analyzed it from start to finish, and immediately started the corresponding plans and experiments: "Go all out to completely finish the Giant Plan.</p><p></p><p>Let me see if the 'Ping-Pong Giant' with the ping-pong space as the brain, semi-condensed spiritual power as the connection to the external foothold, and other substances as the body, can truly allow me to fully control the ping-pong space and freely control its travels."</p><p></p><p>If the Giant Plan didn't work, in the end he may have to wait for his reincarnated main body to be sent over for positioning before trying again.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Su Hao had a specific plan: "To create the Ping-Pong Giant, in principle, I first need to wait several hundred to a thousand years to accumulate enough semi-condensed spiritual power, then try to use the semi-condensed power to capture substances and transform them into sources, and finally use the sources to transform into the various body structures to complete the construction of the Ping-Pong Giant. This process will probably take over a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>But this process can be done concurrently - accumulating semi-condensed spiritual power embedded on the surface of the ping-pong space while trying to capture substances and transform them into sources.</p><p></p><p>This way, it can also accelerate the accumulation of semi-condensed spiritual power, achieving multiple goals at once."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao completed the plan.</p><p></p><p>"Next, go to a planet to complete the accumulation and transformation simulation, then wait for the next time the ping-pong space lands."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Twenty years later, the ping-pong space landed, and Su Hao obtained a large amount of semi-condensed spiritual power attached to its surface.  </p><p></p><p>Another ten years, the semi-condensed spiritual power successfully enveloped some source pearls and moved with the ping-pong space.</p><p></p><p>Another five years, under the effect of the sources, a large amount of matter was transformed into sources and semi-condensed spiritual power, leading to a bumper harvest for the ping-pong space.</p><p></p><p>Another fifteen years, another fission produced a large amount of semi-condensed spiritual power and sources, initially forming a specific structure to capture substances.</p><p></p><p>Another twenty years, the ping-pong space successfully carried away a large amount of common substances.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years later, the outside of the ping-pong space was basically wrapped in a thick layer of semi-condensed spiritual power and a vast amount of source pearls.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Giant Plan had reached the final stage.</p><p></p><p>If Su Hao wished, he could use the vast amount of sources in the outer layer to directly transform into a physical body at any time.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was inside the ping-pong space, quietly observing the outside through its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just like before, the ping-pong space would bounce to another unknown world every so often, forever moving and operating without stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Should I start transforming the Giant's body now?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took a deep breath: "Since everything is ready, what am I waiting for? Let's begin!"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Su Hao's illusory figure inside the ping-pong space dissipated, and the vast amount of source pearls outside suddenly became turbulent, constantly expanding and transforming, changing shape.</p><p></p><p>A huge face radiating white light was generated first, gradually becoming Su Hao's face, mouth slightly open, nostrils breathing, eyes opening...</p><p></p><p>The two brown-black eyes gradually gained a spirited look, gazing into the distant void.</p><p></p><p>White light spread from the head, forming the body and limbs one by one, finally covered by a white robe of light - an incomparably enormous giant stood silently in the void.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao carefully felt this huge body composed of spiritual power and spiritual energy, slowly raising his hand and clenching his fist, then looking down at his fist, an odd feeling lingering in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just like an ordinary person looking down at their own body, yet with a unique special feeling.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this was his body, yet not his body - simply put, it was like a human reincarnating as a humanoid ape, or vice versa...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao opened his mouth to voice the giant's first sentiment: "My..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the ping-pong space disappeared and transferred to another place, slowly carrying his giant body along.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was silent for a moment, then continued: "My body is being controlled by my brain, how strange."</p><p></p><p>The body being controlled by the brain is normal, but for Su Hao's case where the brain was dragging the body around, it seemed quite bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Following the ping-pong space for a while longer, he finally adapted to this rhythm of being dragged around by his brain.</p><p></p><p>He began looking at the surrounding environment - a gloomy, dreary scene, with only his body emitting a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had seen it hundreds of times, Su Hao still couldn't figure out where he was currently located.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head, no need to worry about the location for now. The top priority was to find a way to actively control the ping-pong space, which was currently his brain.</p><p></p><p>Although he had successfully built the Giant's body, being dragged around by the brain wasn't a solution.</p><p></p><p>The essence of building the Giant was to jointly exert force from the inside and outside to find a way to fully control the ping-pong space.</p><p></p><p>"Then I can build a teleportation array on the Giant's body to teleport a clone over."</p><p></p><p>This was something Su Hao had planned long ago - after successfully building the Giant's body, he would construct a teleportation array on it, then teleport a clone over.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Su Hao's reincarnated main body could establish a stable connection with the ping-pong space, allowing Su Hao to stay by the ping-pong space and study it.</p><p></p><p>The giant Su Hao opened his palm, and with a thought, a three-ringed array was engraved on it, soon lighting up to activate the array.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a teleportation array at the experimental base also lit up.</p><p></p><p>The two teleportation arrays successfully connected.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao controlled a [Divine] clone and teleported it onto the giant's palm through the array.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a tiny Su Hao looked up, while the incomparably enormous Su Hao looked down, their four eyes meeting.</p><p></p><p>The legendary "I found myself."</p><p></p><p>So the question is, is the Ping-Pong Giant Su Hao's true self, or is the reincarnated body Su Hao's true self?</p><p></p><p>Without the reincarnated body, the consciousness information of Su Hao recorded in the ping-pong space cannot think, equivalent to non-existence.</p><p></p><p>Without the consciousness information in the ping-pong space, the information in the reincarnated body will also collapse, and Su Hao as a person will cease to exist.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, both the Ping-Pong Giant and the reincarnated body are Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>He is a person with two bodies...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't have time to ponder or feel sentimental about this historic moment. He immediately took out a positioning stone and threw it into the Giant's body.</p><p></p><p>Then the giant Su Hao's palm cracked open a hole, swallowing the [Divine] Su Hao inside.</p><p></p><p>After the crack closed up, the giant disappeared from its original spot, once again carried away by the ping-pong space.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Su Hao's [Divine] clone and the positioning stone also left together.</p><p></p><p>"Successfully positioned the ping-pong space!"</p><p></p><p>Having completed this step, Su Hao felt an indescribable elation.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't all the planning and preparation for the arrival of this day?</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had observed the ping-pong space's appearance from the outside at such a close distance.</p><p></p><p>The ping-pong space was infinitely large, yet also infinitely small, presenting itself to Su Hao in a size he could perceive.</p><p></p><p>It was a feeling difficult to describe clearly.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After these steps, the Giant's body followed the ping-pong space bouncing back and forth between different spatial domains several times.</p><p></p><p>Around ten seconds in outer space, around ten seconds in a dim void.</p><p></p><p>At first Su Hao thought this dim void was the scene observed during the ping-pong space's bouncing movements.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that wasn't the case - this void might be the non-material universe Su Hao had envisioned.</p><p></p><p>He had actually been able to roam in the non-material universe.</p><p></p><p>However, to explore this non-material universe, he would need to fully control the ping-pong space first, staying here for an extended period.</p><p></p><p>"The massive project of 'mastering the ping-pong space' has entered its final stage. With a final push, I can take it down. Heh, I reckon at most a thousand years and I'll be able to fully control the ping-pong space's operation."</p><p></p><p>So in the time that followed, Su Hao continuously tried to control the ping-pong space.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years passed, Su Hao tried various methods.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years passed, Su Hao pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years later, Su Hao encouraged himself to keep striving...</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>One day, Su Hao excitedly found Ya Shan and Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>"Ya Shan, Feng Cheng, are there any important research projects left on the Infinite Lands?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng immediately realized something, their faces showing excitement.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "Grand Master Wei, I no longer have any major research projects. My disciples can complete many tasks, I just need to periodically review the materials they submit."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also said, "Leaving behind a clone or two, or returning every thousand years for a visit is fine."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Since that's the case, I'll take you both to explore another universe!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Grand Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>The exploration of the universe will never stop, but that doesn't preclude them from pioneering a new path of exploration in parallel.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao brought Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's main bodies and teleported them into a space carved out within the Ping-Pong Giant's body. He then controlled the Giant to transfer out of the material universe and into a void.</p><p></p><p>Through repeated attempts, Su Hao found that currently only the ping-pong space could freely move between the material and non-material universes.</p><p></p><p>And the Ping-Pong Giant was like a huge ship, carrying them across the unknowable boundary from the material universe into the non-material universe.</p><p></p><p>After exiting the giant, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng looked around dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Everything was a hazy void, seeming to have light yet also no light at all, unable to discern up and down, left and right, near or far.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the vast expanse of the universe, where even in the most desolate areas faint starlight could be seen in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Here, there was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng squinted hard, carefully examining the surroundings and sweeping it with his mighty divine sense, yet still saw nothing. He even tried to flash step but was unable to use that ability - some of his previous powers were unusable here.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask in amazement, "Grand Master Wei, where is this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily, "I don't know either, still exploring. But I call this place the non-material universe, while the starry space we were in is the material universe. The specifics, I'm also unsure."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan also widened his eyes observing, "The non-material universe? Very fitting, this place is like a void, being here evokes a long-forgotten sense of dread."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded in agreement. If not for Grand Master Wei's presence, coming here alone would likely cause him to be consumed by dread.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Our physical eyes not seeing anything doesn't mean there is nothing here.</p><p></p><p>All of our perceptive abilities are for sensing the material universe, so losing effectiveness in the non-material universe is normal.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to truly see this non-material universe, we need to acquire eyes belonging to the non-material universe.</p><p></p><p>But exactly how, I'm also unsure - we need to gradually explore.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan, Feng Cheng, all of this is unknown. Now, we must start from scratch.</p><p></p><p>Let's see what the true face of this place really is."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Grand Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao suddenly said, "My real name is Su Hao."</p><p></p><p>(End of book!)</p>
